# Email discussion list

Please realize that the main developers are busy with research and teaching themselves and therefore in general cannot be expected to answer each individual question. Therefore we kindly request you to ask for support on the FieldTrip [email discussion list](http://mailman.science.ru.nl/mailman/listinfo/fieldtrip). It aims to foster an open communication among users themselves, and between users and developers.

You can subscribe/unsubscribe yourself on the list's [webpage](http://mailman.science.ru.nl/mailman/listinfo/fieldtrip). Only people who are subscribed to the discussion list can send and will receive messages. Once subscribed, you can send your questions and contributions to <fieldtrip@science.ru.nl>.

## Efficient questions

The users and developers are happy to try to help you with your questions, but it helps if you ask your question in a to-the-point way and if you provide sufficient relevant information. Please read our FAQ on [how to ask good questions to the FieldTrip community](/faq/organization/emaillist_howtoask), consider these [Ten Simple Rules for Getting Help from Online Scientific Communities](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202), and if you're up for a more lengthy read, check out this link that's about [asking smart questions, and providing helpful answers](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
