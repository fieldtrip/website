# Discussion List

Please be considerate that the main developers are busy researchers themselves and cannot answer individual questions. Therefore we kindly request you to ask for support on the FieldTrip [email discussion list](http://mailman.science.ru.nl/mailman/listinfo/fieldtrip). It aims to foster an open communication among users themselves to build up expertise, and between users and developers.

You can send send an email to <fieldtrip-subscribe@science.ru.nl> to subscribe to the FieldTrip list, or to <fieldtrip-unsubscribe@science.ru.nl> to unsubscribe. Only people who are subscribed to the discussion list can send and will receive messages. Once subscribed, you can send your questions and contributions to <fieldtrip@science.ru.nl>.

If you get the message <em>"You are not allowed to post to this mailing list, and your message has been automatically rejected"</em> then please read <a href="/faq/why_am_i_not_allowed_to_post_to_the_discussion_list">this frequently asked question</a>.

## Ask efficient questions

The users and developers are always happy to try to help you with your questions, but note that it helps if you ask your question in a to-the-point way and provide as much relevant information as possible. Please read our FAQ on [how to ask good questions to the FieldTrip community](/faq/how_to_ask_good_questions_to_the_community) and consider these [Ten Simple Rules for Getting Help from Online Scientific Communities](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202).
