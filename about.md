FieldTrip is the MATLAB software toolbox for MEG, EEG and iEEG analysis. It offers preprocessing and advanced analysis methods, such as time-frequency analysis, source reconstruction using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers and non-parametric statistical testing. It supports the [data formats](/faq/preproc/datahandling/dataformat) of all major MEG systems and of the most popular EEG and iEEG systems. New data formats can be [added easily](/faq/preproc/dataformat/dataformat_own). FieldTrip contains high-level functions that you can use to construct your own analysis protocols as a MATLAB script.

The FieldTrip toolbox is released free of charge as [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) under the GNU [general public license](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

FieldTrip is being developed and maintained at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/donders), part of the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands in close collaboration with [collaborating institutes](/external_links#collaborating_institutes). The development of FieldTrip has previously been financially supported by the [Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)](https://www.nwo.nl), the [ChildBrain](https://www.childbrain.eu) project, the [Human Connectome](https://humanconnectome.org) project and by [BrainGain](https://www.braingain.nl).

The development is led by Robert Oostenveld and Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen, and receives many valuable contributions from present and past colleagues from the Donders and many contributors over the world.
