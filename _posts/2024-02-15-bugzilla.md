### 15 February 2024

From about 2009 we used a locally hosted Bugzilla server as “issue tracker” to maintain and distribute to-do lists and supports the follow-up communication between developers and users. Since about 2016 we moved on to [GitHub](/development/git) for project management and issue tracking. We would occasionally still look up some old Bugzilla discussion regarding features, code design choices and bugs.

However, due to resource limitations and security concerns we decided to discontinue the Bugzilla server.  As of now, <https://bugzilla.fieldtriptoolbox.org> contains a read-only archived copy of the bug reports and discussions. All links from the website and from the email archive to bugs on Bugzilla should still work, so the details of past work are not lost.
