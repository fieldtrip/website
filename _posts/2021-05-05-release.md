### 05 May 2021

FieldTrip version [20210505](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20210505) has been released with improved support for handling of fMRI time series data! The idea is to convert a 4D fMRI representation into a source representation, and from there into a parcellated raw data representation from which it would be straight-forward to use the time-domain analysis methods :). An example for this is given on the corresponding [getting started](/getting_started/fmri) page.

In addition, we updated [ft_datatype_parcellation](/reference/utilities/ft_datatype_parcellation) and [ft_datatype_segmentation](/reference/utilities/ft_datatype_segmentation) and added support for [Polhemus](https://polhemus.com/motion-tracking/all-trackers/liberty) motion capture recordings. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20210422...20210505) for the detailed list of updates.
