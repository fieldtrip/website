tweet: Have you (or reviewer #2) ever wondered how to determine the number of subjects that you need to power your cluster-based permutation test ðŸ¤“? Well, Dr. Cheng Wang has just created this very helpful FieldTrip example page (with own code) that shows you how to do that! See https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/#29-march-2021

### 29 March 2021

It is recommended and sometimes even required to provide a sample size estimation prior to starting your data acquisition. [Dr. Cheng Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cheng-Wang-93) has contributed a very nice [example page](/example/samplesize) that demonstrates how to determine the number of subjects to obtain a certain statistical power, also when using cluster-based permutation tests.
