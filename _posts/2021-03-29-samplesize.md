### 29 March, 2021

It is recommended and sometimes even required to provide a sample size estimation prior to starting your data acquisition. [Dr. Cheng Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cheng-Wang-93) has contributed a very nice [example page](/example/samplesize) that demonstrates how to determine the number of subjects to obtain a certain statistical power, also when using cluster-based permutation tests.
