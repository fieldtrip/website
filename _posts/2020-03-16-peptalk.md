### 16 March 2020

Dear friends and colleagues, on behalf of the FieldTrip team we would like to say bon courage to all of you. Right now most of public life has ground to a halt in the Netherlands, like in many other countries. We will be working from home in the coming period but will try to stay operational as much as possible. Among others, we are looking into options to host the upcoming M/EEG toolkit online. Keep your head cool, and take care of yourself and each other. Jan-Mathijs and Robert
