### 09 July 2021

FieldTrip version [20210709](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20210709) has been released with improved coverage of the [testing](/development/testing) scripts that we use to maintain the quality of our releases. This is thanks to [Luca La Fisca](https://github.com/LucaLaFisca) who is working on the [MATLAB for Neuroscience Summer Project](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/projects/3). While implementing the additional tests, we also made several improvements to our low-level source modelling, plotting and connectivity functions. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20210614...20210709) for the detailed list of commits and the [project](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/projects/3) page for the aims that we still hope to realize in the coming month.
