### 11 June 2020

Robert and Jan-Mathijs have made an improvement to how color schemes can be specified. In functions supporting cfg.colormap, you can now also specify a subset of the color schemes that are in matplotlib, as well as the brewermap color schemes (e.g., 'RdBu'). See **[ft_colormap](/reference/plotting/ft_colormap)** for more information.

In this [movie](https://youtu.be/IEGPslJoIE0) you can see Robert and Jan-Mathijs working on this. And finally, as a bonus, we have added an 'ftcolors' colormap, which will give your artwork this extra FieldTrip like feel. Happy plotting!
