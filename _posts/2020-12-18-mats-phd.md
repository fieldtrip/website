### 18 December 2020

Yesterday Mats van Es defended his PhD thesis "On the role of oscillatory synchrony in neural processing" and was awarded the PhD title. Congratulations!

Mats not only used FieldTrip in a number of interesting MEG studies, but also contributed as lecturer in the MEG toolkit courses. Furthermore, he recently implemented the `reproducescript` functionality (which will be published soon). He continues his research at the [MEG center in Oxford](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk).
