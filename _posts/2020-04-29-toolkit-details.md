### 29 April 2020

Last week we hosted the MEG/EEG toolkit course online. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we had to transform it in an online format in which almost everyone (participants and tutors) were attending from home. The format consisted of lectures, extended Q&A sessions, and hands-on sessions where participants worked on tutorials on their own computer. Besides doing it online, this posed additional challenges, with kids at home requiring attention, with time-zone differences, and with some participants now also having clinical duties. This required a lot of creativity of everyone involved, resulting in interesting opportunities. In short: it was a great success, with very good interaction between the about 35 participants and the tutors.  

We have documented the work that went into the preparations, the instruction "manual" that we wrote for the participants and tutors, and also some of the lessons we learned along the way. Furthermore, where possible we recorded the online Zoom lectures and Q&A sessions, allowing others to learn from them as well. Please see the [2020 toolkit page](/workshop/toolkit2020) for all details.
