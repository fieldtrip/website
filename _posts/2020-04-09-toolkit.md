### 9 April 2020

Although we cannot host the M/EEG toolkit in Nijmegen itself, we are happy that it will nevertheless go on. We will host it online, and have created a suitable program for the ~40 selected participants with lectures, online hands-on sessions and a lot of interaction. Getting to know each other, active participation and interacting remains as important online as it would be in normal years. If you want, have a look at the [2020 toolkit page](/workshop/toolkit2020) where the program details will be posted afterwards, and at the list of lecturers and tutors that are enthusiastic about trying out this new format!
