title: 28 May 2020 - Reference docs now on GitHub
categories: [news]

### 28 May, 2020

We have changed the links to the reference documentation (i.e. the help that is at the start of each FieldTrip function) here on the website such that they now point to the code on GitHub, rather than to a Markdown copy of the function help on the website. This makes it possible to scroll down past the help, and to look at the code and the details of the implementation. Also, it makes it easier for you to contribute your suggestions to the help or to the code itself: You can simply click on the "pencil" symbol in the upper right corner.

If you want to know more about contributing, please see [here](/development/contribute). We also have a detailed [git and GitHub](/development/git) tutorial that explains it in much more detail.
