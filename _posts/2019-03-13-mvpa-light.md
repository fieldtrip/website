### 13 March 2019

Check it out! Matthias Treder has kindly contributed a tutorial and some code (streamlined a bit by yours truly) that now allows you to perform MVPA analysis in FieldTrip, using his awesome [MVPA-light toolbox](https://github.com/treder/MVPA-Light) ! For now it is well supported, documented and tested for channel level time domain data, but in the near future (and with your help) we will also ensure support for frequency domain and source level data. For now you can just use **[ft_timelockstatistics](/reference/ft_timelockstatistics)** with cfg.method='mvpa'. The tutorial can be found [here](/tutorial/mvpa_light).
