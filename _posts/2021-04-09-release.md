### 09 April 2021

FieldTrip version [20210409](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20210409) has been released.
See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20210330...20210409) for the detailed list of updates. There's an important fix to ft_statistics_montecarlo, which restores the correct functionality of the cfg.clusteralpha option, which was accidentally broken with commit 205c75d. This affects releases that were released between March 25, and March 30. See issue (#1731) for more information.
