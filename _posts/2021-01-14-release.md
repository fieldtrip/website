### 14 January 2021

FieldTrip version [20210114](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20210114) has been released. It contains improvements to our implementation of Irregular Resampling Auto-Spectral Analysis [IRASA](/example/irasa). Great work by [Rui Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rui-Liu), Robert and Jan Mathijs. Also, we fixed a bug in the computation of non-magnetometer leadfields with openmeeg, thanks to [bknipscheer](https://github.com/bknipscheer). See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20210113...20210114) for the detailed list of updates.
