### 26 September 2023

FieldTrip version [20230926](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20230926) has been released. It has been a while (18 January 2023) since we posted on a new release, but the FieldTrip team has not been sitting still. There have been several contributions and releases in the mean time with lots of improvements to the code. Below we highlight some of the code improvements thanks to contributions by [Syanah](https://github.com/SyanahWynn), [Konstantinos](https://github.com/contsili), [Yarek](https://github.com/yarikoptic), [Nir](https://github.com/NirOfir), [Arno](https://github.com/arnodelorme), [Robert Seymour](https://github.com/neurofractal), [Helena](https://github.com/helenacockx), [Andreas](https://github.com/awollbrink), [Jinbo](https://github.com/Jinboasltw), [Qianqian](https://github.com/fangq), and [Guillaume](https://github.com/gllmflndn).

#### Highlights of the changes since the January 18 2023 version

- Major changes to fieldtrip2fiff to facilitate exchangeability between FieldTrip and MNE-python through the fif-file format.
- Improvements for the support for BIDS derivatives.
- Major improvements of the [testing framework](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/development/testing/), facilitating tests to be run by people external to the DCCN.
- Implementation of Github actions to suggest tests to run to evaluate the integrity of their Pull Requests.
- Support for files created by the SimNIBS software.
- Improved handling of surface/volume meshes for advanced volume conduction modelling.
- Better user experience in ft_sourceplot.
