### 12 June 2018

On 17 June 2018 Maria Carla Piastra, Sophie Schrader and Simon Hom√∂lle will host a workshop the OHBM2018 conference. The course is aimed at researchers who want to learn how to do MEG and/or EEG source reconstruction. This intense one-day workshop will explain state-of-the-art MEG and EEG source reconstruction methods. Special emphasis will be given to new features available now in FieldTrip to solve the EEG and MEG forward solution with advanced finite element methods. The workshop will consist of a number of lectures, followed by hands-on sessions in which you will be tutored through the complete analysis of a MEG, EEG and MRI data set using the FieldTrip toolbox. As the focus is on source reconstruction, topics that will NOT be covered in great detail are segmenting, artifact handling, averaging, frequency and time-frequency analysis, statistics. For the hands-on sessions you should bring a laptop with MATLAB installed. More information about the program can be found at the OHBM website or [here](/workshop/ohbm2018).
