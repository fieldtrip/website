### 20 December 2018

Today we had our end-of-year poster session at the Donders Institute, during which also the Donders Cube has been awarded. This is an institutional award that acknowledges 'beyond-call-of-duty' contributions to the scientific and social life of the Donders Institute, and beyond. We are pleased that this year's award has been awarded to the FieldTrip team! We are proud to be able to work on such a nice project, which wouldn't be in its present shape if it weren't from the interactions with and contributions from the whole FieldTrip community! So, let's keep up the good work for the new year to come, and for now all the best for the holiday season.
