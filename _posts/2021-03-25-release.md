### 25 March, 2021

FieldTrip version [20210325](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20210325) has been released. It features an improved interface to the MVPA-light toolbox thanks to [Matthias Treder](https://github.com/treder). Also, our clustering code has been refurbished to be more generic for univariate data of arbitrary dimensionality. In addition, we have now implemented threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) for multiple comparison correction. This versions also contains various small improvements to figure handling, printing and source functions. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20210311...20210325) for the detailed list of updates.
