### 18 March 2021

From 19-23 April 2021 we will again host the Donders MEG/EEG Tool-kit. Although we would have loved to welcome you in-person in Nijmegen, the ongoing COVID situation restricts traveling and large meetings. However, last year we experienced that in an online format the toolkit course is also really fun, effective and rewarding! Preregistration is now open, please see [here](/workshop/toolkit2021) for further details.
