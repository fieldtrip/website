### 21 April 2020

We kicked off the online MEG/EEG toolkit yesterday, and today it was again in full swing! After this week we will post the material online on the [2020 toolkit page](/workshop/toolkit2020), including details on how we organized the online lectures, interactive sessions and hands-on practical exercises with the tutors being virtually available to help the participants.

See below a "group photo". Actually it is only part of the group; we have about 35 online participants, but Zoom is limited and only shows 25 on a single screen.
