### 5 December 2018

We have completed the move to the new website which you are now seeing. See this [message on the mailing list](https://mailman.science.ru.nl/pipermail/fieldtrip/2018-December/012579.html) for details. The [old website](http://old.fieldtriptoolbox.org) is still available in case you want to look up something there.

If you want to edit any page on this website, please click the "Edit this page on GitHub" link at the bottom of each page. This brings you to [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/website) where you can click the "pen" symbol in the upper right corner. Or have a look at our [git and GitHub](/development/git) tutorial.
