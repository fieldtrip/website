### 09 August, 2022

FieldTrip version [20220809](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20220809) has been released. This release includes a
critical fix for the drop-in replacement of the signal processing toolbox's [resample.m](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/external/signal/resample.m) function, which got the scaling wrong initially.
