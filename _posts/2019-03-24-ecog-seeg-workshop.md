### 24 March 2019

We just completed the first [ECoG/SEEG toolkit](/workshop/davis2019) at the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, California. The three-day event was packed with lectures, hands-on sessions, and fruitful discussions, with people visiting from all over the US (and beyond). Many thanks also to neurosurgeon Fady Girgis and neuroscientist Bob Knight for providing lectures on the clinical aspects and research applications of intracranial EEG. We plan to upload videos of the lectures, so stay tuned.
