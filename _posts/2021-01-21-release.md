### 21 January 2021

FieldTrip version [20210121](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20210121) has been released. It fixes a visualization bug that was recently reported for **[ft_rejectvisual](/reference/ft_rejectvisual)** but also for **[ft_databrowser](/reference/ft_databrowser)**. Now, once again, you can scroll your artefacts with no problems. Many thanks to [Benjy Barnett](https://github.com/benjybarnett). It also includes improvements for checking the `grad` and `elec` sensor structures, which will speed up the execution of your analyses. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20210120...20210121) for the detailed list of updates.
