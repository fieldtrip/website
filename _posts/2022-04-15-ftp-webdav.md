### 15 April 2022

In the past we used an FTP server to distribute files, but as of April 2022 we switched to a new download server that can be found on <https://download.fieldtriptoolbox.org>. It supports [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV), which means that you can download individual files using your web browser. You can also download a complete directory (with subdirectories) at once using a specialized WebDAV client such as [CyberDuck](http://cyberduck.io/) or [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/). On Windows and macOS you can even mount the WebDAV server as a “network file system” and treat it as a network drive.
