### 03 November 2020

FieldTrip version [20201103](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20201103) has been released. We have added the new function [ft_virtualchannel](/reference/ft_virtualchannel) that makes creating virtual channel time-series data easier. Also, we made improved how artifacts can be represented. They can now not only be represented as a Nx2 matrix, but also as a [MATLAB table](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-a-table.html), allowing for a richer representation. We can now keep track of the specific channels that show a threshold or a clipping artifact. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20201009...20201103) for the detailed list of updates.
