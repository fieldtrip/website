### 20 November 2020

fNIRS is often used in freely moving subjects and in motion research. We implemented a FieldTrip [example script](/example/video_eeg) that makes a movie of the fNIRS signal, motion capture, and video data together. The movie demonstrates the fNIRS signals and artifacts synchronously with video data during various movements, such as walking, turning, frowning, head movements and jumping.
