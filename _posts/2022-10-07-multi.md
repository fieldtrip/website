### 07 October 2022

A while ago we have added some new visualization functionality to **[ft_multiplotER](/reference/ft_multiplotER)**, which now allows for MNE-Python style butterfly plots, such as in the attached image. All you need is to specify some options in your cfg: `cfg.viewmode = 'butterfly'`, `cfg.linecolor = 'spatial'`, along with the proper layout. Go and check it out!
