### 11 September 2019

Over the summer [Caroline Witton](https://www2.aston.ac.uk/lhs/staff/az-index/wittonc-0) and Robert have been busy finalizing the [MEG epilepsy tutorial](/tutorial/epilepsy), which has in fact already been hiding on our website for quite some time. About two weeks ago [Elaine Foley](https://www2.aston.ac.uk/lhs/staff/az-index/dr-elaine-foley) presented it at [SuSIE](http://www.imaging-in-epilepsy.org), the Summer School on Imaging in Epilepsy, Epilepsy Surgery and Epilepsy Research, where it was received with enthusiasm. The tutorial demonstrates kurtosis beamforming and virtual channel time series analysis, both on Neuromag and on CTF data, for multiple patients of whom the data is shared on our download server. It also demonstrates how to visualize source reconstruction results with [MRIcro](https://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/crnl/mricro)  and [AnyWave](http://meg.univ-amu.fr/wiki/AnyWave).
