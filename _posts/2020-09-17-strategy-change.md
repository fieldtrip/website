### 17 September 2020

We are changing our [communication](/development/guideline/communication) strategy, which is an integral part of our work! We will continue to use this website for news items and updates on releases, but we will also use Twitter more systematically and to the point. Instead of sending a tweet upon every commit (which made sense in the pre-GitHub days but not any more), we will start sending less frequent but more interesting tweets with important releases, announcements of new features, documentation updates, training events, and other interesting information! So to follow the important news, please keep checking here or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fieldtriptoolbx).
