### 28 September, 2025

FieldTrip version [20250928](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20250928) has been released. It contains several small improvements with respect to the last posted release (20250811).

Some highlights are:
- User transparent revamping of the representation of balancing information for MEG gradiometer arrays, and more consistent handling throughout the code base.
- On-the-fly computation of SSP-projectors in **[ft_denoise_ssp](/reference/ft_denoise_ssp)**, thanks to [Chris](https://github.com/chrisNatMEG).
- Some small improvements to the duneuro functionality.
- Some small improvements to the reading of BlackRock data, thanks to [Arjen](https://github.com/StolkArjen).
- A fix for the 'basedonmni' method when creating source models, thanks to [Tobias](https://github.com/tchaase).
- An efficiency improvement for qsubfeval, avoiding the overhead of higher MATLAB versions to potentially write a large bunch of logfiles, thanks to [Marcel](https://github.com/marcelzwiers). 
- Multiple small other changes to make the codebase more robust, consistent and maintainable. 

See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20250811...20250928) for the detailed list of updates.
