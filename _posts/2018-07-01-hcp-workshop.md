## 01 July 2018

On June 29th, Robert and Jan-Mathijs taught at the Human Connectome Project's workshop, which this year took place in Oxford. During an intense one-week program, 105 participants learnt about the ins and outs of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Did you know that the HCP consortium also collected (and partially analyzed) MEG data from about 100 participants? And that this data is freely available for download? And that the analysis pipelines and software are also available to the community? Check it out on <https://www.humanconnectome.org>.
