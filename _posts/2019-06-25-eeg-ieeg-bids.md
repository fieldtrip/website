### 25 June 2019

[EEG-BIDS, an extension to the brain imaging data structure for electroencephalography](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0104-8) and [iEEG-BIDS, extending the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification to human intracranial electrophysiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0105-7) have just been published in Scientific Data. These two papers describe the extension to the [BIDS standard](https://bids.neuroimaging.io) to allow it not only to store raw (f)MRI and MEG, but also EEG and iEEG data. The full specification is [here](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/); you can find further documentation and examples to work with BIDS [here](/example/bids) on this website.
