### 25 October 2023

We are coming up to the 100-year anniversary of the discovery of human EEG.

In celebration of this seminal moment for human neuroscience, we are asking the FieldTrip, the EEG, and the neuroscience community at large, to document the impact this discovery has had on our understanding of the brain and to share thoughts on the short, medium, and long-term future of human non-invasive scalp EEG through this online survey. Importantly, this survey will also help in defining our collective perspectives on future research priorities.

I hope you will be able to spare the 10-15 minutes it will take to complete the survey and make your views heard about the past and future of EEG.

Thank you for your time.
