### 28 August, 2020

We have been working hard to adapt our existing tools for NIRS data! New FieldTrip release [20200828](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20200828) features several improvements to NIRS data reading, handling and plotting! Moreover, we have added added the option (cfg.newfigure) to output plots onto a new figure (or not)!

#### Commits

- [5b82f4b](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/5b82f4b) FIX - updated read_trigger to deal with regression error due to flank detection and due to denoising, see #1535
- [828f4cf](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/828f4cf) Merge pull request #1534 from robertoostenveld/nirs-reading
- [5b044c3](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/5b044c3) Merge pull request #1533 from robertoostenveld/nirs-plotting
- [21d1045](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/21d1045) renamed cfg.newfigure into cfg.figure
- [28f2fd2](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/28f2fd2) do not assign defaults for headerformat and dataformat, they do not apply in case a data structure is specified as input argument
- [05a7f88](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/05a7f88) give error if there are no channels
- [df0f71b](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/df0f71b) updated help and/or comments
- [87db43b](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/87db43b) cleaned up whitespace, no functional changes
- [f4cea0d](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/f4cea0d) improve denoising and added fixhomer option
- [5753754](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/5753754) represent the homer "s" channels just like the aux and data channels, also for triger detection
- [4cf67c2](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/4cf67c2) added trigger duration based on time between up and down flank
- [0fcf0c4](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/0fcf0c4) try to parse the AUX channel for events if there are no events in nirs.s for homer
- [a5bc749](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/a5bc749) concatenate the AUX channel with the NIRS channels for homer format
- [aa7a36f](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/aa7a36f) concatenate the AUX channel at the end of the data (for Homer NIRS files)
- [88c21d4](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/88c21d4) ensure that hdr.opto is according to the latest standards
- [8312887](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/8312887) renamed opto.transmits into opto.tra and removed opto.laserstrength
- [f955164](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/f955164) opto.transmits serves the same purpose as opto.tra
- [f0329f6](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/f0329f6) corrected documentation for opto.tra and opto.transmits, this was inconsistent with the Artinis implementation
- [9177c14](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/9177c14) opto.transmits serves the same purpose as opto.tra
- [04bbcd7](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/04bbcd7) synchronize ft_fetch_sens over private directories
- [e21b30a](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/e21b30a) use ft_read_header when reading ffrom one of the NIRS file formats, since these all have optode information in the header
- [0f6f9ad](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/0f6f9ad) added support for reading optode and fiducial positions from brainsight_txt
- [15a8520](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/15a8520) imporove construction of NIRS optode layout for plotting
- [2b29292](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/2b29292) pass the skipcomnt and skipscale option from the high level plotting functions to ft_prepare_layout
- [6a0e48a](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/6a0e48a) fixed bug when plotting individual optodes, where the number of optodes is different than the number of channels
- [813b7f1](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/813b7f1) added support for cfg.newfigure=yes/no/new/clf/gcf/handle
- [fd99746](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/fd99746) added support for cfg.newfigure using open_figure() helper function, the default is to open a new one
