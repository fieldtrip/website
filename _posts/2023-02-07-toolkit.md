### 7 February 2023

From May 22-26 we will host our annual MEG/EEG toolkit course at the Donders in Nijmegen. In this 5-day course we will teach you advanced MEG and EEG data analysis skills. Pre-processing, frequency analysis, source reconstruction, connectivity analysis and various statistical methods will be covered. The toolkit consists of a number of lectures, followed by hands-on sessions in which you will be tutored through the analysis of a MEG data set using the FieldTrip toolbox. Furthermore, you have the opportunity to work on your own data with the guidance of experienced tutors.

Preregistration is now open, see [here](/workshop/toolkit2023).
