### 29 August 2024

Robert and Jan-Mathijs have travelled to Sydney to attend Biomag 2024.  We are enjoying lively social interactions and discussions with our friends and colleagues, and listening to interesting scientific stuff. The picture shows Robert in the 'startblokken' for his contribution to the pre-conference OPM workshop.
