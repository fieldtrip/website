### 12 December 2019

Last week at the PracticalMEEG workshop in Paris, Robert, Jan Mathijs and Stephen presented FieldTrip alongside [MNE](https://mne.tools/dev/index.html) and [Brainstorm](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/). You can find all the tutorials - including links to the corresponding tutorials for MNE=-Python and BrainStorm - on the [workshop page](/workshop/paris2019).

The tutorials showcase a full group analysis of the "mmfaces" dataset, starting with raw data organized in BIDS, and going all the way to source-level group statistics.
