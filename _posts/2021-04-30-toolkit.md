### 30 April 2021

From 19-23 April 2021 we hosted the Donders MEG/EEG Tool-kit. Although we would have loved to physically host the toolkit in Nijmegen, the ongoing COVID situation still restricts traveling and large meetings. We had a great week online with over 40 participants and 20 tutors, spanning 10 time zones. Thanks to all participants and tutors for the friendly atmosphere and the constructive interactions!
