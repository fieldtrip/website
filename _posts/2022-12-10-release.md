### 10 December 2022

FieldTrip version [20221210](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20221210) has been released. It includes improvements to channel selection in the graphical user interface of **[ft_databrowser](/reference/ft_databrowser)** and **[ft_rejectvisual](/reference/ft_rejectvisual)**. Furthermore, various small bug fixes and code cleanups were implemented. We removed the peer and engine toolboxes from the code and website documentation, as they were not used by us, nor recommended any more. We are working on improving the documentation on parallel computing using [parfor](https://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/parfor.html) and the MATLAB distributed computing toolbox. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20221126...20221210) for the detailed list of updates.
