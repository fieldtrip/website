### 11 August, 2025

FieldTrip version [20250811](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20250811) has been released.

It contains several small improvements with respect to the latest posted release (20250523):

 - A new compiled mex-file (compiled on a Linux system running Almalinux8) for forward computations based on the duneuro software (previous mex-file was compiled on an old centOS linux system): [12dd619db](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/12dd619db)
 - Better strategy for computing bootstrap samples with low number of observations: [fe35b2384](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/fe35b2384)
 - Revamping of [**ft_icabrowser**](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/contrib/misc/ft_icabrowser.m), which - although not part of core FieldTrip - might be useful for the identification and marking of artifact ICs: [c1e7266e1](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/c1e7266e1)
 - Optional memory/computation speed tradeoff in some of the ft_append* functions: [d3f752dc0](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/d3f752dc0)

See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20250523...20250811) for the detailed list of updates.
