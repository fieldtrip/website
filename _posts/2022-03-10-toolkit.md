### 10 March 2022

From May 9-13 we will host the MEG/EEG FieldTrip data analysis toolkit at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging (DCCN) in Nijmegen. The toolkit course is aimed at PhD and postdoctoral researchers that already have some experience with EEG and/or MEG data acquisition (either a pilot or a full study) and that have a good understanding of their own experimental design. Furthermore, we expect that you know the basics of MATLAB and that you already have some experience with MEG/EEG preprocessing and analysis. We will teach you advanced data analysis methods and cover preprocessing, frequency analysis, source reconstruction, connectivity and various statistical methods. Furthermore, we will give attention to good practices for reproducible research, Open Data and Open Science.

We hope and expect that we will be able to teach this toolkit on site.

See the [toolkit2022](/workshop/toolkit2022) page for further details.
