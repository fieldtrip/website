### 9 October 2020

Robert presented two new features of FieldTrip on the online [LiveMEEG 2020](https://livemeeg2020.org/#Program) conference. We now have the **[data2bids](/reference/data2bids)** function to help you to organize your data in the BIDS structure and to share it. Best do this _before_ you start doing your analysis, so that your analysis scripts can be shared along with the data or publication. Furthermore, all high-level FieldTrip functions now have the `cfg.reproducescript` option that allows you to create a tutorial-style analysis script of everything you do, regardless of how much your original code resembles a plate of spaghetti ;-)

The presentation includes a live demo and has been recorded; you can watch it on [Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/live-meeg-2020/8). The slides of the presentation are available on [SlideShare](http://slideshare.net/RobertOostenveld/how-fieldtrip-can-help-you-with-good-scientific-practices).
