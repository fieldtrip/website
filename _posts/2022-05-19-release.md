### 19 May 2022

FieldTrip version [20220519](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20220519) has been released. It includes support for the Sensys `.csv` fluxgate magnetometer data, for the `.csv` format of the Gtec/Unicorn Hybrid Black mobile EEG system, and updates to the AFNI code and atlases. Furthermore, the **[ft_resampledata](/reference/ft_resampledata)** function now allows for an optional anti-aliasing lowpass filter and will also work if you do not have the MathWorks signal processing toolbox. See this new [FAQ](/faq/resampling_lowpassfilter) on resampling. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20220310...20220519) for the detailed list of updates.
