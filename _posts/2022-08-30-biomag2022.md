### 30 August 2022

After having been postponed for 2 years, Biomag 2020 is 'on'! We are enjoying lively social interactions and discussions with our friends and colleagues, and listening to interesting scientific stuff. The picture shows our own Bob Bramson in action on the stage of the Bramall concert hall at Birmingham University.
