### 1 February 2024

**EEG100 Image Competition - \$500 USD Prize - Closing 29th February 2024**

One hundred years ago Hans Berger undertook the first ever recording of electrical activity from a human brain. The discovery of a "brain script", offered to revolutionise our understanding of mind and brain...

As we celebrate a century of this ground-breaking moment for the neurosciences, the _EEG100 consortium_ invites you to submit creative visual images that provide a homage to the legacy of Berger's discovery and/or present a glimpse into the future possibilities EEG holds. The winning visual will be used by the EEG100 consortium throughout 2024 as part of the centenary year celebrations. The work will for example be included in a scientific commentary article and presented at various conferences (with full acknowledgment).

This competition is open to everyone – whether you’re a hobbyist, a professional artist/designer, or simply a neuroscientist with a creative side. We have no specific demands on visual style or content; we’re looking for originality and creativity – surprise us! We do however ask that you avoid designs like a brain with ‘100’ superimposed on it. Ideally the work would adapt well to various formats, from print to digital display, but we welcome all forms of submissions (image, film, animation etc)! Please be aware that by submitting your design, you agree to release the image to the public domain under a CC license of your choice.

The winner will be determined by vote within the _EEG100 consortium_ based on originality, relevance, and overall visual impact of the submissions. The winning creator will be awarded a \$500 USD gift voucher.

You may submit any common file format (like .jpg, .png, .pdf for images or .mp4 for video) but if your design is chosen, we will ask you to supply your artwork in a production ready format. Please email your submission to century.of.eeg@gmail.com with the subject title "#EEG100 Image Competition" by the end of 29th February 2024 (on the last time zone on earth!).

You will receive a confirmation email upon successful submission.

Decisions will be announced by the end of March 2024.
