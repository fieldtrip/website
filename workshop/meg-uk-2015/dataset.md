The dataset that we analyze in these tutorials is part of a dataset recorded by Rik Hanson and colleagues. In the MEG-UK demonstrations we will only use the MEG data of a single representative subject that is also used in the SPM12 MEG/EEG documentation.

Preprocessing of these data in SPM (which will not be covered at the workshop) is described in detail in the SPM12 manual at <http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/manual.pdf#Chap:data:multi>.
