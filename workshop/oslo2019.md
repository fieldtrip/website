{% include image src="https://www.uio.no/ritmo/bilder/forsidefoto-ritmo-970x400px.jpg" width="650" %}

## Where

RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion  
Forskningsveien 3A  
0373 Oslo  
Norway

**Place of workshop**

Room 3417 Terminalstue Assembler  
Ole-Johan Dahls hus  
Address: Gaustadalléen 23B.  

## When

Wednesday June 12th - Friday June 14th 2019

## Who

The RITMO Centre is the local organizer. Sabine Leske and Alejandro Omar Blenkmann are in charge of the local organization.

Lau Møller Andersen (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm) and Britta Westner (CFIN, Aarhus University) are the lecturers.  

There will be room for ~30 participants. RITMO centre employees and students have priority. When the local organizers have assessed how many RITMO affiliates are attending, the workshop will be open to external participants if there are still places left.

## Links to lectures

N.B.! Note that links to lectures are not up yet, but will before the summer break is over.

## The data used for the hands-on sessions

During the hands-on sessions we will use a task EEG dataset recorded in a auditory [oddball experiment](/workshop/natmeg2014/meg_audodd).

You can download the data from our [download server](https://download.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/oslo2019/). The data can also be provided on a USB stick during the hands-on sessions.

## Installing FieldTrip and setting up MATLAB

For the hands-on sessions you have to start MATLAB. To ensure that everything runs smooth, we will work with a clean version of FieldTrip from the download server.

1.  Download all the files, please keep the same directory structure (i.e. split over hands-on sessions)
2.  Unzip `fieldtrip.zip` file to the folder where you usually keep your MATLAB packages
3.  Unzip `dicom.zip` into a folder called dicom, which should be in the same directory where you keep the other data files (from step 1)

{% include markup/danger %}
Please do NOT use the graphical path management tool from MATLAB. In this hands-on session we'll manage the path from the command line, but in general you are much better off using a startup.m file than the path GUI.

Please do NOT add FieldTrip with all subdirectories, subdirectories will be added automatically when needed, but only when needed.
