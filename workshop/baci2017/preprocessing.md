# Preprocessing of EEG data

## Introduction

This tutorial describes how to define epochs-of-interest (trials) from your recorded EEG-data, and how to apply the different preprocessing steps. This tutorial also shows you how to average your data for a specific experiment (electric wrist stimulation on the right hand).

This tutorial does the preprocessing and segmenting in a single step. If you are interested in how to do preprocessing on your continuous data prior to segmenting it into trials, you can check the [Preprocessing - Reading continuous data](/tutorial/continuous) tutorial.

## Background

In FieldTrip the preprocessing of data refers to the reading of the data, segmenting the data around interesting events such as triggers, temporal filtering and (optionally) rereferencing. The **[ft_preprocessing](/reference/ft_preprocessing)** function takes care of all these steps, i.e., it reads the data and applies the preprocessing options.

There are largely two alternative approaches for preprocessing, which especially differ in the amount of memory required.

- The first approach is to read all data from the file into memory, apply filters, and subsequently cut the data into interesting segments.
- The second approach is to first identify the interesting segments, read those segments from the data file and apply the filters to those segments only.
  The remainder of this tutorial explains the second approach, as that is the most appropriate for large data sets such as the MEG data used in this tutorial. The approach for reading and filtering continuous data and segmenting afterwards is explained in [another tutorial](/tutorial/continuous).

Preprocessing involves several steps including identifying individual trials from the dataset, filtering and artifact rejections. This tutorial covers how to identify trials using the trigger signal. Defining data segments of interest can be done

- according to a specific trigger channel
- according to your own criteria when you write your own trial function, e.g., for conditional trigger sequences, or by detecting EMG onset

Both depend on **[ft_definetrial](/reference/ft_preprocessing)**. The output of **[ft_definetrial](/reference/ft_preprocessing)** is a configuration structure containing the field _cfg.trl_. This is a matrix representing the relevant parts of the raw datafile which are to be selected for further processing. Each row in the `trl` matrix represents a single epoch-of-interest, and the `trl` matrix has 3 or more columns. The first column defines (in samples) the beginpoint of each epoch with respect to how the data are stored in the raw datafile. The second column defines (in samples) the endpoint of each epoch, and the third column specifies the offset (in samples) of the first sample within each epoch with respect to timepoint 0 within that epoch. The subsequent columns can be used to keep information about each trial.

If you do not specify your own triallfunction, the 4th column will by default contain the trigger value. When you use your own triallfunction, you can add any number of extra columns to the _trl_ matrix. These will be added to the data in the _.trialinfo_ field. This is very handy if you want to add information of e.g., response-buttons, response-times, etc., to each trial. As you will see, we will use this functionality to preprocess both the standard and deviant tones together, and then separating them later for averaging.

## Description of the experimental data

For the EEG source reconstruction workshop we recorded a single subject to allow you to work through all basic steps involved in EEG analysis: _from event-related averaging to forward and inverse problem_.

### Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs)

Primary somatosensory cortex (SI) is part of the postcentral gyrus of the human brain. SI consists of Brodmann areas 1, 2, and 3.

Here, the response of interest is the well-known P20/N20 complex (or component) which is generated in area 3b (part of the Brodmann areas 3). The generators of this area are mainly focal not too deep and mainly tangentially oriented ([Allison et al. 1989](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2769354)).

#### Estimation of the P20/N20 component

The median nerve of the subject's right wrist was stimulated using square electrical pulses with 0.5 ms duration. The stimulus strength was adjusted to see a clear movement of the thumb. The inter-stimulus interval was varied randomly between 350 to 450 ms to avoid habituation and to obtain a clear pre-stimulus interval. A reduction in stimulus artifacts was achieved by reversing the polarity of the stimulation during the second half of the measurement.

#### Triggers

The EEG system records event-triggers in separate channels. These channels are recorded simultaneously with the data channels, and at the same sampling rate. The onset can therefore be precisely timed with respect to the data. The following trigger codes can be used for the analysis we will be doing during the worksho

- Onset of standard stimulus: 2
- Name of standard stimulus : rightArm

#### Data

- Data was sampled at 1200Hz.
- 74 channel EEG. The reference was placed on the FCz channel.
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded as a bipolar recording from the collarbones.
- Horizontal EOG(1) electrodes were placed just next to the left and right eye. Vertical EOG(2) were placed above and below the left eye.
- 10 minutes of recording (5 minutes with normal polarity of the electric pulses and 5 with inverse polarity of the electric pulses)

## Preprocessing and averaging EEG

## Procedure

The following steps are taken in the EEG section of the tutorial:

- Define segments of data of interest (the trial definition) using **[ft_definetrial](/reference/ft_definetrial)**
- Read the data into Matlab using **[ft_preprocessing](/reference/ft_preprocessing)**
- Clean the data in a semi-automatic way using **[ft_rejectvisual](/reference/ft_rejectvisual)**
- Compute event-related fields using **[ft_timelockanalysis](/reference/ft_timelockanalysis)**
- Compute global mean field power using **[ft_globalmeanfield](/reference/ft_globalmeanfield)**
- Visualize the results using **[ft_topoplotER](/reference/ft_topoplotER)**, and **[ft_multiplotER](/reference/ft_multiplotER)**

## Reading and preprocessing the interesting trials

To get going, you need to start MATLAB. Then, you need to issue the following command

    clc
    clear
    close all
    restoredefaultpath    % restore default folder for matlab

    maindir = pwd;        % keep main path

    cd fieldtrip-20170701 % set up the path of fieldtrip

    addpath(pwd)
    ft_defaults

    cd(maindir)           % return to main

We start with the trial definition using **[ft_definetrial](/reference/ft_definetrial)** and **[ft_preprocessing](/reference/ft_preprocessing)**.

    data_name              = 'subject01.ds';        % define the data path and its name

    % Read events
    cfg                    = [];
    cfg.trialdef.prestim   = 0.1;                   % in seconds
    cfg.trialdef.poststim  = 0.2;                   % in seconds
    cfg.trialdef.eventtype = 'rightArm';            % get a list of the available types
    cfg.dataset            = data_name;             % set the name of the dataset
    cfg_tr_def             = ft_definetrial(cfg);   % read the list of the specific stimulus

    cfg                    = [];
    cfg.dataset            = data_name;
    cfg.channel            = 'eeg1010';             % define channel type
    data                   = ft_preprocessing(cfg); % read raw data

    % segment data according to the trial definition
    data                   = ft_redefinetrial(cfg_tr_def, data);

We will filter the data using **[ft_preprocessing](/reference/ft_preprocessing)** around the frequency spectrum of interest and eliminate the power line noise before calculating the SEPs with **[ft_timelockanalysis](/reference/ft_timelockanalysis)**.

    cfg                = [];
    cfg.hpfilter       = 'yes';        % enable high-pass filtering
    cfg.lpfilter       = 'yes';        % enable low-pass filtering
    cfg.hpfreq         = 20;           % set up the frequency for high-pass filter
    cfg.lpfreq         = 250;          % set up the frequency for low-pass filter
    cfg.dftfilter      = 'yes';        % enable notch filtering to eliminate power line noise
    cfg.dftfreq        = [50 100 150]; % set up the frequencies for notch filtering
    cfg.baselinewindow = [-0.1 -0.02];    % define the baseline window
    data               = ft_preprocessing(cfg,data);

    save data data -v7.3

The output of data is the structure data which has the following field

    data =
             hdr: [1x1 struct]
            elec: [1x1 struct]
         fsample: 1200
      sampleinfo: [1198x2 double]
           trial: {1x1198 cell}
            time: {1x1198 cell}
           label: {74x1 cell}
             cfg: [1x1 struct]

We will use **[ft_rejectartifact](/reference/ft_rejectartifact)** to clean the data of bad trials (and perhaps channels). We use only the 'zvalue' criterion to eliminate bad trials (or channels). You can play around with other criterion where you can reject trial.

    cfg        = [];
    cfg.metric = 'zvalue';  % use by default zvalue method
    cfg.method = 'summary'; % use by default summary method
    data       = ft_rejectvisual(cfg,data);

## Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs)

### Timelockanalysis

The function **[ft_timelockanalysis](/reference/ft_timelockanalysis)** averages all the trials into a single trial. It requires preprocessed data, i.e. what we just did.

The trials belonging to one condition will now be averaged with the onset of the stimulus time aligned to the zero-time point. This is done with the function **[ft_timelockanalysis](/reference/ft_timelockanalysis)**. The input to this procedure is the data structure generated by **[ft_preprocessing](/reference/ft_preprocessing)**.

    cfg                   = [];
    cfg.preproc.demean    = 'yes';    % enable demean to remove mean value from each single trial
    cfg.covariance        = 'yes';    % calculate covariance matrix of the data
    cfg.covariancewindow  = [-0.1 0]; % calculate the covariance matrix for a specific time window
    EEG_avg               = ft_timelockanalysis(cfg, data);

### Data rereferencing

We should rereference the averaged EEG data for later use in the inverse problem, [inverse problem](/workshop/baci2017/inverseproblem).

    cfg               = [];
    cfg.reref         = 'yes';
    cfg.refchannel    = 'all';
    cfg.refmethod     = 'avg';
    EEG_avg           = ft_preprocessing(cfg, EEG_avg);

### Global Mean Field Power

Global Mean Field Power (GMFP) is a measure first introduced by [Lehmann and Skandries (1979)](<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0013-4694(80)90419-8>), used by, for example, [Esser et al. (2006)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2005.11.003) as a measure to characterize global EEG activity.

GMFP can be calculated using the following formula (from [Esser et al. (2006)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2005.11.003))
{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/baci2017/preprocessing/gmfp.png" %}

where t is time, V is the voltage at channel i and K is the number of channels.

FieldTrip has a built-in function to calculate the GMFP; [ft_globalmeanfield](/reference/ft_globalmeanfield). This function requires timelocked data as input. We will use similar preprocessing as applied in [Esser et al. (2006)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2005.11.003).

    % global mean field power calculation for visualization purposes
    cfg         = [];
    cfg.method  = 'amplitude';
    EEG_gmfp    = ft_globalmeanfield(cfg, EEG_avg);

### Plotting the results of EEG

Using the plot functions **[ft_topoplotER](/reference/ft_topoplotER)** and **[ft_multiplotER](/reference/ft_multiplotER)** you can plot the average of the trials. You can find information about plotting also in the [Plotting data at the channel and source level](/tutorial/plotting) tutorial. Furthermore, we use the below script to visualize single trial with global mean field power and we find the time of interest and we save it together with the EEG_avg.

    figure

    pol = -1;     % correct polarity
    scale = 10^6; % scale for eeg data micro volts

    signal = scale * pol * EEG_avg.avg; % add single trials in a new value

    % plot single trial together with global mean field power
    h1 = plot(EEG_avg.time,signal, 'color',[0,0,0.5]);
    hold on;
    h2 = plot(EEG_avg.time,scale*EEG_gmfp.avg, 'color',[1,0,0], 'linewidth',1);

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/baci2017/preprocessing/baci_sep_singleploter.png" width="600" %}

_Figure 2: Representation of single trial (blue) and the global mean field power (red)._

We set up values to create the image you observe before.

    legend([h1(1,1),h2],{'EEG', 'GMFP'});
    grid on;
    ylabel('SEP (\muV)', 'Interpreter', 'Tex');
    xlabel('Time (s)')
    set(gca, 'fontsize',18, 'fontname', 'Century Gothic');

    mx = max(max(signal));
    mn = min(min(signal));
    axis([EEG_avg.time(1) EEG_avg.time(end) mn mx])

    % select time of interest for the source reconstruction later on
    idx = find(EEG_avg.time>0.024 & EEG_avg.time<=0.026);
    toi = EEG_avg.time(idx);

    [mxx,idxm] = max(max(abs(EEG_avg.avg(:,idx))));
    toi_mean_trial = toi(idxm);

We save the data and the picture.

    % save the single trial with the time of interest
    save('EEG_avg.mat', 'EEG_avg', 'toi_mean_trial')

    set(gcf, 'Position',[1 1 1200 800])
    print -dpng baci_sep_singleplotER.png

Use **[ft_multiplotER](/reference/ft_multiplotER)** to plot all sensors in one figure:

    cfg          = [];
    cfg.fontsize = 6;
    cfg.layout   = 'elec1010.lay';
    cfg.fontsize = 14;
    cfg.ylim     = [-5e-6 5e-6];
    cfg.xlim     = [-0.1 0.2];

    figure
    ft_multiplotER(cfg, EEG_avg);

    set(gcf, 'Position',[1 1 1200 800])
    print -dpng baci_sep_multiplotER.png

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/baci2017/preprocessing/baci_sep_multiploter.png" width="600" %}

_Figure 3: Use of ft_multiplotER for representation of the single trial according to the EEG cap._

Use **[ft_topoplotER](/reference/ft_topoplotER)** to plot the topographic distribution over the head:

    cfg            = [];
    cfg.zlim       = 'maxmin';
    cfg.comment    = 'xlim';
    cfg.commentpos = 'title';
    cfg.xlim       = [toi_mean_trial toi_mean_trial+0.01*toi_mean_trial];
    cfg.layout     = 'elec1010.lay';
    cfg.fontsize   = 14;

    figure
    ft_topoplotER(cfg, EEG_avg);

    set(gcf, 'Position',[1 1 1200 800])
    print -dpng baci_sep_topo.png

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/baci2017/preprocessing/baci_sep_topo.png" width="400" %}

## Summary and suggested further reading

In this tutorial we learned how to look at EEG data, define trials based on trigger codes, preprocess the data (including filtering, artifact rejection, re-referencing, and average the data to SEPs). We then learned how to display the results in terms of their time courses as well as their corresponding topographies.

The next step of workshop will be the source reconstruction among different head models and different inverse methods with [forward problem](/workshop/baci2017/forwardproblem) and
[inverse problem](/workshop/baci2017/inverseproblem).
