%% Time-frequency analysis on short and long timescales
%
%% # Introduction
%
% In this tutorial we will be looking at frequency analysis, and specifically at time-frequency analysis on short time scales (around the stimulus) and long time scales (over the course of hours). This tutorial is an adaptation from [this](/tutorial/timefrequencyanalysis/) and [this](/tutorial/sleep/) tutorial, using an EEG dataset that was recorded in a language experiment.
%
% Using this tutorial you will learn how to do EEG preprocessing, time-frequency analysis and continuous analysis (as if it were sleep or resting-state data). After this tutorial, you could continue with the [tutorials on statistics](/tutorial/#statistics), or with one of the example scripts on using general linear modeling (GLM) on [time series data](/example/glm_timeseries) or over [trials](/example/glm_trials).
%
% We assume that you are already familar with the basic concepts of EEG processing, that you know how to use MATLAB, and that you have some idea on how to use FieldTrip. The focus will be on explaning the strategy used for data analysis, i.e. building a FieldTrip analysis pipeline, and explaining the options relevant for the analysis.
%
% In case EEG, preprocessing, spectral analysis and FieldTrip are new to you, we recommend you watch some of the [video lectures](/video).
%
%% # Procedure
%
% This tutorial comprises four sections that can in principle be executed (mostly) independently from each other, but we recommend going through them sequentially.
%
% # Epoching, ERPs, difference, visualization
% # Epoching, TFRs, difference, visualization
% # Excursion: EOG removal to reduce confounds
% # Continuous analysis, chunked spectral decomposition
%
%% # The dataset used in this tutorial
%
% The EEG dataset used in this tutorial was acquired by Irina Siminova in a study investigating semantic processing of stimuli presented as pictures, visually displayed text or as auditory presented words. The data is also used elsewhere on this website for other [tutorials and examples](/tag/eeg-language), but in this tutorial we will specifically be using the [curated version](/workshop/cuttingeeg2021/bids_language) in which the data has been organized according to the [BIDS standard](/example/bids). This is especially relevant here, as it allows us to use explicitly coded stimulus descriptions instead of numerical trigger codes.
%
% The EEG data was acquired with a 64-channel BrainProducts BrainAmp EEG amplifier from 60 scalp electrodes placed in an electrode cap, one electrode placed under the right eye; the "EOGv" and "EOGh" channels are computed after acquisition using re-referencing. During acquisition all channels were referenced to the left mastoid and an electrode placed at the earlobe was used as the ground. Channels 1-60 correspond to electrodes that are located on the head, except for channel 53 which is located at the right mastoid. Channels 61, 62, 63 are not connected to an electrode at all. Channel 64 is connected to an electrode placed below the left eye. Hence we have 62 channels of interest: 60 from the head + eogh + eogv. More details on the experiment and data can be found [here](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/eeg_language/).

%% # Epoching, ERPs, difference, visualization
%
%% ## Define the epochs
%
% This part creates a definition of epochs, based on the events that are stored in the BIDS format, i.e. in an events.tsv file. This is a file in tabular format, which allows for the representation of events in a format that is more human-readable, and more directly interpretable, than the more abstracted trigger codes as returned by **[ft_read_event](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/fileio/ft_read_event.m)**.
%
cfg                   = [];
cfg.dataset           = 'sub-02/eeg/sub-02_task-language_eeg.vhdr';
cfg.trialfun          = 'ft_trialfun_bids'; % this will find the events.tsv file
cfg.trialdef.prestim  = 0.2;
cfg.trialdef.poststim = 0.8;
cfg.trialdef.task     = 'notarget';
cfg.trialdef.category = {'tools', 'animals'};

cfg = ft_definetrial(cfg);

% The relevant field that is added to the cfg by **[ft_definetrial](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/ft_definetrial.m)** is the so called |trl| field, which contains a specification of begin and end samples of the requested epochs, where the samples are expressed relative to the start of the recording. Here, the trl is actually a [table](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/tables.html), containing a lot more useful - and directly interpretable - information. Don't forget to scroll to the right, because that's where the interesting info is located, note that the below code prints a subset of 3 trials, which intends to show that the modality of stimulation occurred in blocks of 400 repetitions:

%
%% ## Load the data and rereference
%
% Rereferencing here is done to the linked mastoids. The recording reference (placed on the left mastoid) is an implicit channel, and does not show up in the dataset. The other reference channel, on the right mastoid, in this dataset corresponds to channel '53'.
%

data_segmented     = ft_preprocessing(cfg);

%
%% ## Reject artifacts
%
% This step allows to do a relatively quick and dirty visual rejection of data segments, based on the variance of the in the epochs. Other heuristics can be used as well. The argument keeptrial determines here that the bad segments do not disappear from the data structure, but will be represented by NaNs. More information about this processing step can be found in the [visual artifact rejection](/tutorial/visual_artifact_rejection/) tutorial.

%
%% ## Filter and average spoken and written modality
%
% In the next step we compute the average for groups of trials that belong to specific conditions, here the spoken and written modalities. In addition a lowpassfilter is applied to the data, to make the ERPs appear 'cleaner'. Note the use of the |trialinfo| field in the data, which in this case is in tabular format, allowing for a more straightforward specification of the condition of interest (i.e., it does not need to look up abstract event codes).

% The **[ft_math](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/master/ft_math.m)** function allows to perform mathematical operations on the numeric data, while keeping track of the processing steps. This is beneficial in relation to reproducibility of results. Specifically, the below could also easily be obtained by the creation of a new variable `animals_minus_tools`, and storing the difference in its 'avg' field: `animals_minus_tools.avg = timelock_animals.avg - timelock_tools.avg`. This is not ideal, since we could easily lose track of how the numeric data were actually generated. As an bonus exercise, you could explore the history of a FieldTrip variable by looking in its cfg field:

% # The spatial topography of the beta ERD has two focal minima in left posterior electrodes, and is thus suggestive of visual cortex activation.
% # The TFRs of the frontal electrodes appear to be swamped by a large power low frequency effect.
%
% Exercise: Explore the data of the other condition, as well as the difference between written and spoken presentation, by using the above chunk of code, but with the other variables in the input.
%
%% # Excursion: EOG removal to reduce confounds
%
% In this experiment we have both visual/written and auditory/spoken stimulus material. Although the 'basic' processing pipeline presented above allowed for interpretable TFRs, you were able to observe that eye movements and blinks contaminated the EEG data quite substantially. Particularly, when (involuntary) eye movements are not fully independent of the experimental manipulation (e.g., eye movements might occur more often in the written modality trials than in the spoken trials, or eye movements tend to occur after stimulus onset) these artifacts cause 'structure' in the data that does not reflect brain activity. For this reason it is common to 'remove' eye related signals from the data, for instance using independent component analysis or related techniques. Below, we use 'DSS', which is a nephew of ICA, to quickly identify and remove eye movement related signals.

% The figures investigate the same individual channels' TFRs, and the corresponding topographies of prominent features therein. As can be seen, the effect of the eye blink removal has hardly an effect on the TFR in the right occipital electrode, but makes a big difference for the frontal electrode. Even though there still seems to be a residual of the eye blinks in the TFR after DSS, the TFR now reveals more clearly an occipital increase in power between 8 and 15 Hz, around 100-200 ms after stimulus onset. This is most likely the frequency transform of the stimulus-evoked transient, and does not necessarily reflect an oscillation in the alpha band/low beta band.
%

%% # Continuous analysis, chunked spectral decomposition
%
% And now for something completely different. The next part of this tutorial deals with an analysis that treats the data more as a continuous chunk, rather than a collection of experimentally relevant epochs. The idea behind this, is that there might be fluctuations in some aspects of the brain signals, on longer time scales than the relevant cognitive events, which could interact with the way in which the brain responds to those events. Below we are going to perform a time-frequency analysis on the whole >1 hour recording. This part of the tutorial can be eplored on itself, for which the data needs to be processed from the raw datafile.

% Alternatively, if you have performed the previous parts of the tutorial, you could start from using the continuous data that has been cleaned from eye blink related artifacts. We used those data for the figures presented below.

%
%% ## Segment the continuous data in overlapping chunks
%
% Although the data will now be segmented, the consecutive individual 'epochs' still represent a continuous sequence of intermediate length pieces of data (in the below case) of 5 seconds long. These pieces of data can for instance be used to estimate slow fluctuations in power at specific frequencies, on a slower time scale than the individual trials. Still, such an analysis might provide relevant information, because it could reveal fluctuations in alpha power that might serve as a proxy for fluctuations in arousal or engagement with the task. Such estimates could then subsequently be used as a confound for more sophisticated statistical modelling of experimental effects in the data. For instance, rather than computing experimental effects based on difference in the mean one could consider using a generalized linear model (GLM).
%
% After cutting the continuous data into artificial epochs for spectral analysis, we will stitch the data back together again. As a side note, you may rightfully ask why this is done, since we could just as well compute a Time-frequency representation of the continuous data right away? The answer is that this conceptually is indeed what one wants to achieve, yet it's computationally not feasible. Here, we are dealing with a more than one hour long recording, consisting of more than 2.000.000 samples. Imagine what would happen with a night long sleep recording!

%% # Summary and conclusion
%
% In this tutorial we demonstrated EEG preprocessing, event-related potentials (ERPs), artifact removal using DSS, time-frequency analysis and continuous analysis.
%
% The next steps in the analysis that are not covered here would consist of processing the data from more participants and doing statistics. You could continue with one of the following:
%
%* Creating a clean and efficient [analysis script](/tutorial/scripting/)
%* You can follow one of the [tutorials on statistics](tutorial/#statistics)
%* You can look at the example scripts for [GLM on time series data](/example/glm_timeseries/) or [GLM over trials](/example/glm_trials/)
%* You can have a look at the [sleep tutorial](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/sleep/) to learn more about the analysis of long continuous recordings
