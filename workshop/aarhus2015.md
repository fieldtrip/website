# FieldTrip workshop in Aarhus

Aarhus University (IMC and Cfin) will be hosting a FieldTrip Course on EEG/MEG Analysis with Jim Herring and Luca Ambrogioni from 7 to 9 of October 2015. Registration to the limited places is open now via the link below. Externals will be charged a fee of 150 Euro.

### When

Wed 07 Oct- Fri 09 Oct, 2015.

### Who

Jim Herring and Luca Ambrogioni, organized by Tzvetan Popov.

This workshop is an **advanced** workshop and will not cover basic MEG EEG analysis steps. Familiarity with FieldTrip is required and will be provided by Kousik Sarathy and Mikkel Vinding on Tue 06.10.15 in the Meeting room of CFIN, 5th floor. It is also recommended to read the [FieldTrip](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2011/156869/) reference papers to understand the toolbox design.

To prepare for the hands-on session, you should watch the following online videos prior to the workshop. Note that these lectures are about one hour each, which means that you should **plan ahead and take your time** to go through them. It is your own responsibility to come well-prepared. Starting one day in advance will not cut it!

- [FieldTrip intro (video and hands-on)](/tutorial/introduction)
- [Frequency analysis (video and hands-on)](/tutorial/timefrequencyanalysis)
- [Beamformer source analysis (video and hands-on)](/tutorial/beamformer)

Also, make sure you have downloaded the hands-on data prior to the start of the workshop as it is quite a large download. All the required data and a recent version of FieldTrip can be downloaded [here](https://download.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/aarhus2015/workshop/hands-on.rar).
