# SQUIDs versus OPMs

## Introduction

Traditional MEG systems use superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which require expensive cryogenic cooling with liquid helium and involve placing the sensors 1.5-2 cm from the scalp. Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), a new generation of MEG, eliminate the need for cryogenic cooling, allowing sensors to be placed closer to the scalp. OPMs are small individual sensors that allow the researcher to choose where to place them over the head. These sensors are held in place by 3D-printed helmets, which can be customized for each subject.

Even though, both SQUID and OPM system detect the brain's magnetic fields, their data analysis steps differ a bit. In this tutorial we explore the differences in preprocessing and coregistration between the two systems.

OPMs are flexible in their placement allowing for new recording strategies. These new recording strategies lead to new data analysis strategies. For example, in this tutorial we use a small number of OPMs (32 sensors) and do sequential recordings in which we position them over different places over the scalp.

OPMs are magnetometers, as their name suggests. Magnetometers are more sensitive to environmental noise than gradiometers, which most SQUID systems have. Several data analysis algorithms to remove environmental noise have been proposed (see [Seymour et al (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811921011058?via%3Dihub) for more details). In this tutorial, we apply homogeneous field correction (HFC). HFC works better with a large number of sensors.

Unlike SQUID systems, which have standard coregistration strategies, OPMs don't have a single standard. In this tutorial, we coregister the OPMs with the MRI using an optical 3D scanner which captures the participant’s facial features along with the OPM helmet ([Zetter et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41763-4)).


This tutorial combines the FieldTrip tutorials on [preprocessing of Optically Pumped Magnetometer (OPM) data](tutorial/preprocessing_opm/) and [coregistration of Optically Pumped Magnetometer (OPM) data](tutorial/coregistration_opm/). It does not cover follow-up analyses (like source reconstruction) which in principle should not differ from the SQUID follow-up analyses, or alternative coregistration methods which are covered in the tutorial on [coregistration of Optically Pumped Magnetometer (OPM) data](tutorial/coregistration_opm/).

## Background


In this tutorial we will use recordings made with 32 OPM sensors placed in an adult-sized “smart” helmet with a total of 144 slots. This helmet is called “smart” as each slot allows the sensor to slide in until it touches the head surface, regardless of the head size and shape. To limit head movements we mounted the helmet on a wooden plate.

To acquire a measurement for each of the 144 helmet slots, we divided the experiment into six runs. To maintain the participant's head fixed between runs, we kept 9 sensors around the participant’s head fixed for all the runs. The remaining 23 sensors were moved to different helmet slots in each run to cover the whole scalp as homogeneously as possible.

### The dataset used in this tutorial
The data for this tutorial was recorded with a 32-sensor FieldLine HEDscan v3 system with a so-called smart helmet. Each OPM sensor has one channel that measures the normal component of the magnetic field. 

We perform a left median nerve stimulation experiment on a single participant in both the SQUID and the OPM system. We expect to find a dipole 20 ms post-stimulation in the right primary somatosensory area ([Andersen & Dalal, 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34089874/); [Buchner et al., 1994](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01211175)). 

The dataset can be downloaded from our [download-server](https://download.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/cuttingeegx).

## Procedure

## Preprocessing & computing ERFs
### SQUID
We begin by loading the SQUID data and defining trials. In the experiment, the inter-trial interval ranged from 800-1200 ms. We select a 200 ms prestimulus and 400 ms poststimulus window. We then select trials where left median nerve stimulation occurred (trigger code = 1).

```
%% Preprocessing & trial definition

cfg                     = [];
cfg.dataset             = 'sub-01_ses-01_task-MedianNervesStim_squid.ds'; % add the whole path to your meg file
cfg.trialdef.eventtype  = 'UPPT001';
cfg.trialdef.eventvalue = [1]; 
cfg.trialdef.prestim    = 0.2; 
cfg.trialdef.poststim   = 0.4;
cfg                     = ft_definetrial(cfg);

cfg.demean         = 'yes';  
cfg.baselinewindow = [-Inf 0]; 
cfg.channel        = 'MEG';
cfg.continuous     = 'yes';
data_squid         = ft_preprocessing(cfg);

save data_squid data_squid
```

The summary method in **[ft_rejectvisual](/reference/ft_rejectvisual)** allows to manually remove trials and/or channels that have high variance. 

```
%% Removing artifacts manually

load data_stim data_stim

cfg              = [];
cfg.method       = 'summary';
data_squid_clean = ft_rejectvisual(cfg, data_squid);

save data_squid_clean data_squid_clean
```


We start by removing trials that have higher variance than 8e-25 Tesla-squared, then assess the channels. Removing trials also reduces channel variance, so no need to reject any channels. 

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/cuttingeegx/cuttingeegx_ft_rejectvisual.png" width="500" %}

We then calculate the ERFs: 

```
%% Computing ERFs

load data_squid_clean data_squid_clean

cfg       = [];
avg_squid = ft_timelockanalysis(cfg, data_squid_clean);

save avg_squid avg_squid
```

We plot the activity from all the sensors.

```
%% Plotting ERFs

load avg_squid avg_squid

cfg = [];
cfg.layout = 'CTF275_helmet';
ft_multiplotER(cfg, avg_squid); % use interactively
```

{% include markup/skyblue %}
Interactive mode: Explore the event-related potential by dragging boxes around (groups of) sensors and time points in the ‘multiplot’ and the resulting ‘singleplots’ and ‘topoplots’. Can you find the time window that the dipolar activity at the right primary somatosensory area appears?
{% include markup/end %}

We can also plot this dipolar pattern with **[ft_topoplotER](/reference/ft_topoplotER)**.

```
%% Plotting the topography

cfg = [];
cfg.xlim = [0.035 0.050];
cfg.layout = 'CTF275_helmet';
ft_topoplotER(cfg, avg_squid); 

print -dpng cuttingeegx_topo_squid.png
```
{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/cuttingeegx/cuttingeegx_topo_squid.png" width="500" %}
### OPM

```
%% Preprocessing & trial definition

f = dir('*.fif'); % add the whole path to your .fif files
f = struct2cell(f);

 for i = 1:6  % 6 experimental runs  

    cfg                     = [];
    cfg.dataset             = fullfile(f{2,i},f{1,i});
    cfg.trialdef.eventtype  = 'ai61';
    cfg.trialdef.eventvalue = [1];
    cfg.trialdef.prestim    = 0.2; 
    cfg.trialdef.poststim   = 0.4;
    cfg                     = ft_definetrial(cfg);
    
    cfg.demean         = 'yes';  
    cfg.baselinewindow = [-Inf 0];
    cfg.channel        = {'all', '-ai61'};
    data_opm(i)        = ft_preprocessing(cfg);

 end

save data_opm data_opm
```

OPM are magnetometers which are more sensitive to the environmental noise than the SQUID gradiometers. To remove some of the environmental noise, we can apply a denoising technique called homogeneous field correction (HFC) to clean the data.

```
%% HFC

load data_opm data_opm

for i=1:6
    data_opm_nohdr(i) = rmfield(data_opm(i), 'hdr'); % it is needed so that ft_denoise_hfc() works

    cfg               = [];
    data_opm_hfc(i)   = ft_denoise_hfc(cfg, data_opm_nohdr(i));
end

save data_opm_hfc data_opm_hfc
```

We will now manually remove trials with high variance. 

{% include markup/skyblue %}
For the SQUID-based recordings, we removed trials with variance above the threshold of 8e-25 Tesla-squared. Is it possible to use the same threshold for the OPMs? If not, why and does this affect the quality of the OPM signal? Remember that (i) OPMs are magnetometers, and (ii) they are placed closer to the scalp than the SQUIDs.
{% include markup/end %}

```
%% Removing artifacts manually

load data_opm_hfc data_opm_hfc

for i=1:6
    cfg                   = [];
    cfg.method            = 'summary';
    data_opm_hfc_clean(i) = ft_rejectvisual(cfg, data_opm_hfc(i));
end

save data_opm_hfc_clean data_opm_hfc_clean
```

```
%% Computing ERFs

load data_opm_hfc_clean data_opm_hfc_clean

for i=1:6
    cfg        = [];
    avg_opm(i) = ft_timelockanalysis(cfg, data_opm_hfc_clean(i));
end 

save avg_opm avg_opm
```
Before concatenating the six runs, we need to rename duplicate channels. Duplicates arise for three reasons: (i) 9 sensors were fixed across all runs, (ii) some sensors in the sixth run were in the same slot as the fifth run due to limited remaining free slots, and (iii) errors by the researcher placing a sensor in same slot between runs. During the recording an excel sheet was used to keep track in which slot each sensor was placed. We use that information to rename the channels.

```
%% Renaming channels

load avg_opm avg_opm

avg_opm_rename = avg_opm;

% 9 sensors were fixed across all runs. Note L101 was not working so we do not need to rename it. 
for k = 2:6
    index = find(ismember(avg_opm(k).label, {'R101_bz', 'L108_bz','R503_bz','L503_bz','L507_bz','R507_bz','R212_bz','L212_bz'})); % 2 in the back, 2 right, 2 left, 1 front, 1 top
    for i = 1:length(index)
        avg_opm_rename(k).label{index(i)} = strcat(avg_opm(k).label{index(i)}, '_', num2str(k));
    end
end

% Some sensors in the sixth run were in the same slot as the fifth run
for k = 6 % 6th run
    index = find(ismember(avg_opm_rename(k).label, {'R114_bz', 'L504_bz'})); % rename 'R114_bz', 'L504_bz'
    for i = 1:length(index)
        avg_opm_rename(k).label{index(i)} = strcat(avg_opm_rename(k).label{index(i)}, '_', num2str(k));
    end
end

% Researchers' errors
for k = 2 % 2nd run 
    index = find(ismember(avg_opm_rename(k).label, {'L214_bz'})); % rename 'L214_bz'
    for i = 1:length(index)
        avg_opm_rename(k).label{index(i)} = strcat(avg_opm_rename(k).label{index(i)}, '_', num2str(k));
    end
end

for k = 5 % 5th run
    index = find(ismember(avg_opm_rename(k).label, {'R504_bz', 'L504_bz'})); % rename 'R504_bz', 'L504_bz'
    for i = 1:length(index)
        avg_opm_rename(k).label{index(i)} = strcat(avg_opm_rename(k).label{index(i)}, '_', num2str(k));
    end
end

save avg_opm_rename avg_opm_rename
```

We concatenate ERFs across the six runs to simulate a single experiment with 144 sensors (note: there are some missing sensors, so in the end we do not have 144 sensors).

```
%% Append the ERFs over the six runs

load avg_opm_rename avg_opm_rename

cfg           = [];
cfg.appenddim = 'chan';
append_opm    = ft_appendtimelock(cfg, avg_opm_rename(1), avg_opm_rename(2), avg_opm_rename(3), avg_opm_rename(4), avg_opm_rename(5), avg_opm_rename(6));

% renaming the appended averages to "avg" as this is the default in
% FieldTrip
append_opm.avg = append_opm.trial;
append_opm     = rmfield(append_opm, 'trial');

save append_opm append_opm
```

There are some missing sensors. To avoid interpolation or extrapolation artifacts in the topography, we can add NaNs for the missing sensors and then tell to **[ft_topoplotER](/reference/ft_topoplotER)** to exclude those using the ```'cfg.interpolatenan = no'``` option.

```
%% Add NaNs to the missing channels

load fieldlinebeta2bz_helmet.mat 
missing = setdiff(layout.label, append_opm.label); 

% missing =
% 
%   8×1 cell array
% 
%     {'L101_bz'}
%     {'L105_bz'}
%     {'L312_bz'}
%     {'L604_bz'}
%     {'R105_bz'}
%     {'R603_bz'}
%     {'R604_bz'}
%     {'R605_bz'}

% make a copy of the original timelock structure, remove two fields that we don't care about
append_opm_nan = rmfield(append_opm, {'dof', 'var'});

% add NaNs to the extra slots from the helmet that are missing 
append_opm_nan.label = cat(1, append_opm_nan.label(:), missing(:));
append_opm_nan.avg   = cat(1, append_opm_nan.avg, nan(numel(missing), numel(append_opm_nan.time)));

save append_opm_nan append_opm_nan
```

```
%% Plotting ERFs

load append_opm_nan append_opm_nan
 
cfg            = [];
cfg.layout     = 'fieldlinebeta2bz_helmet';
cfg.showlabels = 'yes';
cfg.ylim       = 'maxabs';
ft_multiplotER(cfg, append_opm_nan);
```

```
%% Plotting the topography

cfg                = [];
cfg.xlim           = [0.035 0.050];

## Coregistration 

### SQUID
We are now going to coregister the anatomical MRI to the SQUID coordinate system. We read the MRI, SQUID channels and the Polhemus headshape in memory. We recommend converting all quantities to SI units to ensure consistent units throughout your pipeline.

```
%% Loading files & converting to SI units

mri    = ft_read_mri('sub-01_acq-mprage_T1w.nii');
ctf275 = ft_read_sens('sub-01_ses-01_task-MedianNervesStim_squid.ds', 'senstype', 'meg');
shape  = ft_read_headshape('sub-01_ses-01_headshape.pos');

mri    = ft_convert_units(mri, 'm');
ctf275 = ft_convert_units(ctf275, 'm');
shape  = ft_convert_units(shape, 'm');

save mri mri
save ctf275 ctf275
save shape shape
```
{% include markup/skyblue %}
To understand coregistration, you first need to know what [coordinate systems](faq/coordsys.md) are. Coregistration is about aligning these coordinate systems. Start by plotting the MRI, SQUID sensors, and Polhemus headshape to see their coordinate systems. You can use **[ft_determine_coordsys](/utilities/ft_determine_coordsys)** for that.
{% include markup/end %}

We co-register the SQUIDs with the MRI by converting the MRI coordinate system to match that of the SQUIDs. In other words, we ensure that the three fiducials (nasion, LPA and RPA) defining the MRI coordinate system are aligned to the same three fiducials defining the SQUID coordinate system.

```
%% Co-registering the anatomical MRI to the SQUID coordinate system

load shape shape
load ctf275 ctf275

% assign the 'ctf' coordinate system to the MRI 
cfg          = [];
cfg.method   = 'interactive';
cfg.coordsys = 'ctf'; % ALS coordinate system
mri_realigned1 = ft_volumerealign(cfg, mri);

save mri_realigned1 mri_realigned1
```

To refine the coregistration, we can also coregister the Polhemus head shape with the skin surface that is extracted from the previously aligned MRI. Now not only the fiducials but also other skin surface points acquired with the Polhemus are used for the alignment.

```
%% Refining co-registration using the Polhemus scan

load mri_realigned1 mri_realigned1

cfg = [];
cfg.method = 'headshape';
cfg.headshape.headshape = shape;
mri_realigned2 = ft_volumerealign(cfg, mri_realigned1); 

% check 
cfg = [];
cfg.method = 'headshape';
cfg.headshape.headshape = shape;
cfg.headshape.icp = 'no';
ft_volumerealign(cfg, mri_realigned2); 

save mri_realigned2 mri_realigned2
```


Let's plot the sensor topography in 3D using **[ft_plot_topo3d](/reference/plotting/ft_plot_topo3d)**. This will help us visualize where the sensors are positioned relative to the head. To make this clearer, we'll also display the scalp and brain surfaces.

First, we'll prepare the surface mesh of the scalp and brain:

```
%% Preparing the surface mesh of the scalp and brain

load mri_realigned2 mri_realigned2

cfg                = [];
cfg.output         = {'brain', 'scalp'};
mri_segmented      = ft_volumesegment(cfg, mri_realigned2);

cfg                = [];
cfg.tissue         = {'brain'};
mesh_brain         = ft_prepare_mesh(cfg, mri_segmented);

cfg                = [];
cfg.tissue         = {'scalp'};
mesh_scalp         = ft_prepare_mesh(cfg, mri_segmented);

save mesh_brain mesh_brain
save mesh_scalp mesh_scalp
```

Now, we'll plot the 3D sensor topography for the time window [0.035, 0.050] seconds, along with the brain and scalp:

```
%% Plotting the 3D sensor topography

% average the activity of interest in the time window [0.035 0.050] sec
sampling_rate = 1200; % in Hz
prestim = 0.2;

I1 = (prestim+0.035)*sampling_rate; 
I2 = (prestim+0.050)*sampling_rate;

selected_avg = mean(avg_stim.avg(:, I1:I2), 2);

% Plot
figure;
ft_plot_mesh(mesh_scalp, 'facealpha', 0.5, 'facecolor', 'skin', 'edgecolor', 'none', 'edgecolor', 'skin' )
hold on
ft_plot_mesh(mesh_brain, 'facecolor', 'brain', 'edgecolor', 'none');
hold on
ft_plot_topo3d(pos275,selected_avg, 'facealpha', 0.9)
camlight
view([360 0])

print -dpng cuttingeegx_topo3d_squid.png
```
{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/cuttingeegx/cuttingeegx_topo3d_squid.png" width="500" %}

### OPM

We will coregister the OPMs with the MRI using an optical 3D scanner which captures the participant’s facial features along with the OPM helmet. First we read and plot the optical scan:

```
%% Loading files

scan      = ft_read_headshape('sub-01-ses-01_opticalscan.obj');
scan.unit = 'm'; % assign the correct unit

figure; hold on;
ft_plot_headshape(scan);
ft_plot_axes(scan);
lighting gouraud
material dull
light
```

We assign the RAS coordinate system to the scan.

```
%% Assign coordinate system

cfg          = [];
cfg.method   = 'fiducial';
cfg.coordsys = 'neuromag'; 
scan_aligned = ft_meshrealign(cfg, scan); 

figure; hold on;
ft_plot_headshape(scan_aligned);
ft_plot_axes(scan_aligned);
view([125 10]);
lighting gouraud
material dull
light

save scan_aligned scan_aligned
```

We remove irrelevant parts such as the body and cables. We use the **[ft_defacemesh](/reference/ft_defacemesh)** function with a bounding box to keep only the desired head area.

```
%% Remove Body and Cables

cfg           = [];
cfg.method    = 'box';
cfg.selection = 'inside';
scan_head     = ft_defacemesh(cfg, scan_aligned); 

figure; hold on;
ft_plot_headshape(scan_head);
ft_plot_axes(scan_head);
view([125 10]);
lighting gouraud
material dull
light

save scan_head scan_head
```

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/cuttingeegx/scan_head.png" width="500" %}


We isolate the face region from the 3D scan using a bounding box. We will later align this face with the face extracted from the MRI.

```
%% Isolate face

cfg           = [];
cfg.method    = 'box';
cfg.selection = 'inside';
scan_face     = ft_defacemesh(cfg, scan_head);

figure; hold on;
ft_plot_headshape(scan_face);
ft_plot_axes(scan_face);
view([125 10]);
lighting gouraud
material dull
light

save scan_face scan_face
```

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/cuttingeegx/scan_face.png" width="500" %}


Next, we isolate the helmet region from the 3D scan using a bounding box. We will later align this helmet with the reference helmet (i.e., the 3D model of the actual FieldLine helmet).

```
%% Isolate helmet
cfg           = [];
cfg.method    = 'box';
cfg.selection = 'outside';
scan_helmet   = ft_defacemesh(cfg, scan_head);  

figure; hold on;
ft_plot_headshape(scan_helmet);
ft_plot_axes(scan_helmet);
view([125 10]);
lighting gouraud
material dull
light

save scan_helmet scan_helmet
```

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/cuttingeegx/scan_helmet.png" width="500" %}


We load the MRI. As the same participant took part in both SQUID and OPM recordings, we can reuse his/her segmented MRI from the SQUID analysis to save time: 

```
load mri_segmented mri_segmented % from the SQUID analysis
```

We align face from the 3D scan with the face extracted from the MRI.

```
%% Aligning the face from the 3D scan with the face extracted from the MRI

% create a mesh for the scalp
cfg             = [];
cfg.tissue      = 'scalp';
cfg.numvertices = 10000;
mri_face        = ft_prepare_mesh(cfg, mri_segmented);

save scan_face_aligned scan_face_aligned

% alignment
cfg               = [];
cfg.method        = 'interactive';
cfg.headshape     = mri_face;
cfg.meshstyle     = {'edgecolor', 'k', 'facecolor', 'skin'};
scan_face_aligned = ft_meshrealign(cfg, scan_face);

We align the helmet from the 3D scan with the reference helmet. For this we use the 3D model of the actual FieldLine helmet. The reference helmet only contains the rim around the face.
```

helmet_rim = ft_read_headshape('fieldlinebeta2_helmet_rim.mat');

cfg                 = [];

cfg.headshape       = helmet_rim;
cfg.meshstyle       = {'edgecolor', 'none', 'facecolor', [1 0.5 0.5]};

The three objects (the optical 3D scan, the face from the MRI and the template helmet) are initially all expressed in different coordinate systems. In the previous steps we have determined two pairwise transformations, which can be combined and used to align each of the objects to any other object.

Now we can use the transformation that aligns the face from the 3D scan with the face from the anatomical MRI and the transformation that aligns the helmet from the 3D scan with the reference helmet to calculate the transformation that aligns the reference helmet with the anatomical MRI.
```
%% Calculate transformation matrix

transform_scan2helmet = scan_helmet_aligned.cfg.transform;
transform_scan2face   = scan_face_aligned.cfg.transform;
transform_helmet2face = transform_scan2face/transform_scan2helmet; 
```

The transformation matrix ```'transform_helmet2face'``` can now be used to coregister the the OPM sensors with the MRI, which aligns the OPM sensors with head-based coordinate system. Before applying the transformation, we need to read the OPM sensors from the six fif files and combine them into a single sensor file. In the FieldLine system the OPM sensors slide into the smart helmet; the fif file contains the actual position of the sensors relative to the helmet. 

```
%% Read the sensors

f = dir('*.fif'); % add the whole path to your .fif files
f = struct2cell(f);
sens = struct();

for i=1:6
    sensfile = fullfile(f{2,i},f{1,i});
    sens(i) = ft_read_sens(sensfile);
end

save sens sens

cfg      = [];
sens_combined = ft_appendsens(cfg, sens(1), sens(2), sens(3), sens(4), sens(5), sens(6)); % removes the duplicate channels

save sens_combined sens_combined
```

We apply the transformation to align the OPM sensors with head-based coordinate system
```
%% Apply transformation matrix

fieldlinebeta2_head = ft_transform_geometry(transform_helmet2face, sens_combined);

save fieldlinebeta2_head fieldlinebeta2_head

figure; hold on;
ft_plot_sens(fieldlinebeta2_head, 'label', 'off');
ft_plot_headshape(mri_face, 'facecolor', [0.5 0.5 1], 'facealpha', 0.4, 'edgecolor', 'none');

Lastly, we plot the 3D sensor topography for the time window [0.035, 0.050] seconds, along with the scalp:

```
%% Plotting the 3D sensor topography

load mesh_brain mesh_brain % from the SQUID analysis
load mesh_scalp mesh_scalp % from the SQUID analysis
load fieldlinebeta2_head fieldlinebeta2_head
load append_opm append_opm

% find the indices of append_opm.label that match the ones in fieldlinebeta2_head.label
i_avg = ismember(append_opm.label, fieldlinebeta2_head.label);

% 'R603_bz', 'R105_bz' were duplicate sensors, so they need to be omitted
i_sens = ~ismember(fieldlinebeta2_head.label, {'R603_bz', 'R105_bz'}); 

% average the activity of interest in the time window [0.035 0.050] sec
sampling_rate = 5000; % in Hz
prestim = 0.2;

I1 = (prestim+0.035)*sampling_rate; 
I2 = (prestim+0.050)*sampling_rate;

selected_avg = mean(append_opm.avg(:, I1:I2), 2);
