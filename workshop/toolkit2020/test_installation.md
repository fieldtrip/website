# Test your MATLAB and FieldTrip installation in advance

_These are the instructions we sent to the participants in the week prior to the toolkit._

Prior to the hands-on sessions, we want you to provide us with some information with respect to the computational setup you have on your end. This is needed for us to anticipate (and ideally fix) any restrictions on your end. Also, it is needed to avoid a lot of time to be spent during the first session to get everybody up-and-running.

Therefore, please start MATLAB on your computer, copy-and-paste the code below into the MATLAB command line, and make a screenshot of the output you get on your screen. Please upload this screenshot in your personal hands-on notes google document so that we can check.

    fprintf('################################################################\n');
    fprintf('computer: %s\n', computer);
    ver('MATLAB');

    [ftver, ftpath] = ft_version;
    fprintf('FieldTrip path is at: %s\n', ftpath);
    fprintf('FieldTrip version is: %s\n', ftver);
    fprintf('ttest is:        %s\n', which('ttest'))
    fprintf('imdilate is:     %s\n', which('imdilate'));
    fprintf('dpss is:         %s\n', which('dpss'));
    fprintf('fminunc is:      %s\n', which('fminunc'));
    fprintf('ft_read_data is: %s\n', which('ft_read_data'));
    fprintf('runica is:       %s\n', which('runica'));  % should not be found yet, or the fieldtrip version
    fprintf('spm is:          %s\n', which('spm'));     % should not be found yet, or the fieldtrip version
    fprintf('################################################################\n');

If you get an error that says `Undefined function or variable 'ft_version'.` please add FieldTrip to the MATLAB path and try again. See [here](/faq/installation) for more information about adding FieldTrip to the MATLAB search path.
