# Statistical analysis and multiple comparison correction for EEG data

## Introduction

The objective of this tutorial is to give an introduction to the statistical analysis of EEG data using different methods to control for the false alarm rate. The tutorial starts with sketching
the background of cluster-based permutation tests. Subsequently it is shown how to use FieldTrip to perform statistical analysis (including cluster-based permutation tests) on the time-frequency response to a movement, and to the auditory mismatch negativity. The tutorial makes use of a between-trials (within-subject) design.

In this tutorial we will continue working on the dataset described in the [Preprocessing and event-related activity](/workshop/oslo2019/introduction) and the [Time-frequency analysis of MEG and EEG](/workshop/natmeg2014/timefrequency) tutorials. We will repeat some code here to select the trials and preprocess the data. We assume that the preprocessing and the computation of the ERFs/TFRs are already clear to the reader.

This tutorial is not covering group analysis. Look [here](/tutorial/eventrelatedstatistics) for that. If you are interested, you can read the other tutorials that cover cluster-based permutation tests on [event-related fields](/tutorial/cluster_permutation_timelock) and on [time-frequency data](/tutorial/cluster_permutation_freq). If you are interested in a more gentle introduction as to how parametric statistical tests can be used with FieldTrip, you can read the [Parametric and non-parametric statistics on event-related fields](/tutorial/eventrelatedstatistics) tutorial.

## Background

The topic of this tutorial is the statistical analysis of multi-channel EEG data. In cognitive experiments, the data is usually collected in different experimental conditions, and the experimenter wants to know whether there is a difference in the data observed in these conditions. In statistics, a result (for example, a difference among conditions) is statistically significant if it is unlikely given the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the conditions. The "unlikeliness" is evaluated according to a predetermined threshold probability, the alpha level.

An important feature of EEG data is that it has spatio-temporal structure, i.e. the data is sampled at multiple time-points and sensors. The nature of the data influences which kind of statistics is the most suitable for comparing conditions. If the experimenter is interested in a difference in the signal at a certain time-point and sensor, then the more widely used parametric tests are sufficient. If it is not possible to predict where the differences are, then many statistical comparisons are necessary which lead to the _multiple comparisons problem_ (MCP). The MCP arises from the fact that the effect of interest (i.e., a difference between experimental conditions) is evaluated at an extremely large number of (channel,time)-pairs. This number is usually in the order of several thousands. Now, the MCP involves that, due to the large number of statistical comparisons (one per (channel,time)-pair), it is not possible to control the so called _family-wise error rate_ (FWER) by means of the standard statistical procedures that operate at the level of single (channel,time)-pairs. The FWER is the probability, under the hypothesis of no effect, of falsely concluding that there is a difference between the experimental conditions at one or more (channel,time)-pairs. A solution of the MCP requires a procedure that controls the FWER at some critical alpha-level (typically, 0.05 or 0.01). The FWER is also called the _false alarm rate_.

When parametric statistics are used, one method that addresses this problem is the so-called Bonferroni correction. The idea is if the experimenter is conducting _n_ number of statistical tests then each of the individual tests should be tested under a significance level that is divided by _n_. The Bonferroni correction was derived from the observation that if _n_ tests are performed with an _alpha_ significance level then the probability that one test comes out significant is smaller than or equal to _n_ times _alpha_ (Boole's inequality). In order to keep this probability lower, we can use an _alpha_ that is divided by _n_ for each test. However, the correction comes at the cost of increasing the probability of false negatives, i.e. the test does not have enough power to reveal differences among conditions.

In contrast to the familiar parametric statistical framework, it is straightforward to solve the MCP in the nonparametric framework. Nonparametric tests offer more freedom to the experimenter regarding which test statistics are used for comparing conditions, and help to maximize the sensitivity to the expected effect. For more details see the publication by [Maris and Oostenveld (2007)](/references_to_implemented_methods#statistical_inference_by_means_of_permutation).

## Procedure for ERPs

### Before we begin

We will clear all variables that we have in the workspace, restore the default path, add fieldtrip and run _ft_defaults_

    clear variables
    restoredefaultpath

    addpath /home/lau/matlab/fieldtrip/ %% set your own path
    ft_defaults

### Load the ERP data and preprocess

    load cleaned_data_ERP.mat
    load ERP_deviant.mat
    load ERP_standard.mat
    load difference_wave.mat
    load elec.mat

First, we load the data that we created in the [ERP tutorial](/workshop/oslo2019/introduction)

{% include markup/info %}
Note the naming convention used - each saved _.mat-file_ contains _one and only one_ variable, which has the _same_ name as the _.mat-file_  
This makes it clear what variables are loaded into the workspace.
{% include markup/end %}

We then apply the same preprocessing as before.

    cfg                = [];
    cfg.lpfilter       = 'yes';
    cfg.lpfreq         = 30;
    cfg.demean         = 'yes'; % we demean (baseline correct) ...
    cfg.detrend        = 'yes'; % removing linear trends
    cfg.baselinewindow = [-Inf 0];% using the mean activity in this window

    data_EEG_filt = ft_preprocessing(cfg, cleaned_data_ERP);

#### The Student's t-test

A ubiquitous test used to assess statistical significance is the Student's t-test [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test) [original article](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/6.1.1).  
To perform the t-test, _t-values_ need to be calculated, which a bit simplified are: \frac{µ}{SEM}, where µ is the mean difference between the conditions and SEM is the standard deviation divided by \sqrt{n}, where _n_ is the number of observations.

We will do a within-subject between-trials statistical test.
We proceed by computing the statistical test, which returns the t-value, the probability and a binary mask that contains a 0 for all data points where the probability is below the a-priori threshold, and 1 where it is above the threshold. The _cfg.design_ field specifies the condition in which each of the trials is observed. For the _indepsamplesT_ statistic, it should contain 1's and 2's.

    cfg           = [];

    cfg.method    = 'analytic'; % using a parametric test
    cfg.statistic = 'ft_statfun_indepsamplesT'; % using independent samples
    cfg.correctm  = 'no'; % no multiple comparisons correction
    cfg.alpha     = 0.05;

    cfg.design    = data_EEG_filt.trialinfo; % indicating which trials belong ...
                                             % to what category
    cfg.ivar      = 1; % indicating that the independent variable is found in ...
                       % first row of cfg.design

    stat_t = ft_timelockstatistics(cfg, data_EEG_filt);

_stat_t_ contains:

    stat_t =

           stat: [128x200 double]
             df: 572
        critval: [-1.9641 1.9641]
           prob: [128x200 double]
           mask: [128x200 logical]
         dimord: 'chan_time'
           elec: [1x1 struct]
          label: {128x1 cell}
           time: [1x200 double]
            cfg: [1x1 struct]

- _stat_ contains the _t-values_ at all channels and time points
- _df_ is the degrees of freedom determining the _t-distribution_ that the _t-value_ is compared against to obtain the _p-values_
- _critval_ contains the critical values for the test performed; if a _t-value_ is lesser than the negative value or greater than the positive value, the difference is declared significant. The _critval_ is dependent on _cfg.alpha_ and the degrees of freedom (_df_)
- _prob_ contains the _p-values_ assciated with the _t-values_ given the degrees of freedom (_df_)
- _mask_ is a _logical_ matrix, 0's are where _p-values_ (_prob_) are greater than _cfg.alpha_, 1's are where they are lesser than _cfg.alpha_
- _dimord_ indicates the ordering of dimensions, rows are channels and columns are time
- _elec_ contains information about the electrodes, e.g., positions and names
- _label_ contains the names of all channels
- _time_ is a row vector with the time points in seconds
- _cfg_ shows the cfg that gave rise to this structure

We can now plot the ERPs using the field _cfg.maskparameter_ of the plotting functions: **[ft_multiplotER](/reference/ft_multiplotER)**, **[ft_singleplotER](/reference/ft_singleplotER)** and **[ft_topoplotER](/reference/ft_topoplotER)**

Here, we will show **[ft_singleplotER](/reference/ft_singleplotER)**

    ERP_standard.mask = stat_t.mask; % adding mask to ERP

    figure

    cfg               = [];
    cfg.layout        = 'natmeg_customized_eeg1005.lay';
    cfg.maskparameter = 'mask';
    cfg.maskstyle     = 'box';
    cfg.maskfacealpha = 0.5; % transparency of mask
    cfg.channel       = 'EEG124';
    cfg.ylim          = [-5e-6 5e-6]; % Volts

    ft_singleplotER(cfg, ERP_standard, ERP_deviant);
    hold on
    xlabel('Time (s)')
    ylabel('Electric Potential (V)')
    plot([ERP_standard.time(1), ERP_standard.time(end)], [0 0], 'k--') % hor. line
    plot([0 0], cfg.ylim, 'k--') % vert. l
    axes = gca;
    legend(axes.Children([10 3]), {'Standard', 'Deviant'})

    print -dpng singleplot_t_uncorrected.png

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/oslo2019/singleplot_t_uncorrected.png" width="650" %}
_Figure 1: Single channel plot - no correction_

{% include markup/info %}
Note that we see the MMN difference (~120-200 ms), but we also see other differences and even a pre-zero one. We cannot decide which are _true positives_ and which are _false positives_. In fact, we know that there will be a lot _false positives_ (assuming that the data were from identical distributions, i.e. the null hypothesis is true, we would expect that 5% of our significant differences are _false positives_)
{% include markup/end %}

#### Bonferroni correction

We will now control the _false positives_ by using the Bonferroni Correction [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction)

    cfg           = [];

    cfg.method    = 'analytic'; % using a parametric test
    cfg.statistic = 'ft_statfun_indepsamplesT'; % using independent samples
    cfg.correctm  = 'bonferroni'; % correction method
    cfg.alpha     = 0.05;

    cfg.design    = data_EEG_filt.trialinfo; % indicating which trials belong ...
                                             % to what category
    cfg.ivar      = 1; % indicating that the independent variable is found in ...
                       % first row of cfg.design

    stat_t_bonferroni = ft_timelockstatistics(cfg, data_EEG_filt);

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/oslo2019/singleplot_t_bonferroni.png" width="650" %}
_Figure 2: Single channel plot - Bonferroni correction_

{% include markup/info %}
The Bonferroni correction has eliminated some likely _false positives_, but probably at the expense of introducing some _false negatives_. According to our image, only the peak of our MMN is significant. But EEG responses are not peaky in nature, they wax and wane smoothly in time and are smeared out over several electrodes. The Bonferroni correction implicitly assumes that EEG responses are uncorrelated, which they are patently not. Our next correction, the _cluster correction_ addresses the issue of correlation.
{% include markup/end %}

#### Cluster-based correction for multiple comparisons

As noted above, EEG data is smooth over the spatio-temporal dimensions. We can easily imaging how we can build clusters in the temporal dimension. These are simply data points that are neighbouring each other in time. For the spatial dimension, it is necessary to build a neighbour structure using **[ft_prepare_neighbours](/reference/ft_prepare_neighbours)**. This uses the (digitized) positions of the electrodes.

##### Neighbors

{% include markup/danger %}
Sometimes we use the word 'neighbour' according to the British spelling and sometimes we use it as neighbor according to the American spelling.
{% include markup/end %}


    cleaned_data_ERP.elec = elec; % add the elec structure

    cfg          = [];
    cfg.method   = 'triangulation';
    cfg.feedback = 'yes'; % visualizes the neighbors

    neighbors = ft_prepare_neighbours(cfg, cleaned_data_ERP);

    print -dpng neighbor_structure.png

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/oslo2019/neighbor_structure.png" width="650" %}
_Figure 3: Electrode neighbor structure_

##### Permutation

The cluster correction is not meaningful for parametric statistics, e.g., _t-tests_, therefore we are going to use a non-parameteric test.  
We will first run it and then discuss some of the options and details afterwards.

    cfg                  = [];
    cfg.method           = 'montecarlo'; % use montecarlo to permute the data
    cfg.statistic        = 'ft_statfun_indepsamplesT'; % function to use when ...
                                                       % calculating the ...
                                                       % parametric t-values

    cfg.correctm         = 'cluster'; % the correction to use
    cfg.clusteralpha     = 0.05; % the alpha level used to determine whether or ...
                                 % not a channel/time pair can be included in a ...
                                 % cluster
    cfg.alpha            = 0.025; % corresponds to an alpha level of 0.05, since ...
                                  % two tests are made ...
                                  % (negative and positive: 2*0.025=0.05)
    cfg.numrandomization = 100;  % number of permutations run

    cfg.design           = data_EEG_filt.trialinfo; % same design as before
    cfg.ivar             = 1; % indicating that the independent variable is found in ...
                              % first row of cfg.design
    cfg.neighbours       = neighbors; % the spatial structure
    cfg.minnbchan        = 2; % minimum number of channels required to form a cluster

    stat_t_cluster = ft_timelockstatistics(cfg, data_EEG_filt);

The output of _stat_t_cluster_ is:

    stat_t_cluster =

                       prob: [128x200 double]
                posclusters: [1x11 struct]
        posclusterslabelmat: [128x200 double]
            posdistribution: [1x100 double]
                negclusters: [1x14 struct]
        negclusterslabelmat: [128x200 double]
            negdistribution: [1x100 double]
                    cirange: [128x200 double]
                       mask: [128x200 logical]
                       stat: [128x200 double]
                        ref: [128x200 double]
                     dimord: 'chan_time'
                      label: {128x1 cell}
                       time: [1x200 double]
                        cfg: [1x1 struct]

- _prob_ contains the _p-values_ for each channel/time pair inherited from the cluster that pair is part of
- _posclusters_ contains a structure for each positive cluster found that contains
  - _prob_ contains the _p-value_ associated with the cluster
  - _clusterstat_ contains the _T-value_ associated with this cluster
  - _stddev_ contains the standard deviation of the _prob_ of this cluster
  - _cirange_ contains the 95% confidence interval for the _prob_ of thus cluster - if this range include _cfg.alpha_ a warning is issued recommending increasing the number of permutations
- _posclusterslabelmat_ contains a matrix with a number indicating which positive cluster each channel/time pair belongs (0 if it doesn't belong to
- _posdistribution_ contains a row vector containing the _T-value_ for each of the permutations
- _negclusters_ contains the negative equivalent of _posclusters_
- _negclusterslabelmat_ contains the negative equivalent of _negclusterslabelmat_
- _negdistribution_ contains the negative equivalent of _posdistribution_
- _cirange_ contains the 95% confidence interval for the _prob_
- _mask_ is a _logical_ matrix, 0's are where _p-values_ (_prob_) are greater than _cfg.alpha_, 1's are where they are lesser than _cfg.alpha_
- _stat_ contains the _t-values_ (the first step)
- _ref_ contains the mean value of the _t-value_ over all of the permutations
- _dimord_ indicates the ordering of dimensions, rows are channels and columns are time
- _label_ contains the names of all channels
- _time_ is a row vector with the time points in seconds
- _cfg_ shows the cfg that gave rise to this structure

There's quite a lot to unpack here. It is critical to distinguish between _t-values_ and _T-values_ here. We will now state the procedure step by step.

1. Do a _t-test_ similar to above (_stat_t_) - these provide the _t-values_ in _stat_t_cluster.stat_
2. Find the _T-values_ for each cluster of _t-values_ that pass the analytic significance test based on _cfg.clusteralpha_. The _T-value_ for a cluster is the sum of all the _t-values_ in that cluster
3. Permute the condition labels (_cfg.design_) as many times as set in _cfg.numrandomization_; then compute the _t-values_ (as in step 1 above), and compute the _T-values_ for each of the clusters that pass the analytic significance test based on _cfg.clusteralpha_ (as in step 2 above).
4. For each of the _cfg.numrandomization_ permutations, retrieve the maximum _T-value_, and create a permutation based distribution of _T-values_
5. Observe the likelihood of the maximum _T-value_ under the permuted distribution for the _positive clusters_ direction and evaluate at _cfg.alpha_
6. Repeat step 5 for the _negative clusters_

Below follows some figures and operations illustrating key features of these steps - (the code for these plots in the **Appendix** below)

###### Equivalence of the _t-values_ (step 1)

_Figure 6: The observed positive and negative_ T-values compared to the permuted distributions

###### Compare against _cfg.alpha_ (steps 5 and 6)

Since both the _positive_ and _negative p-values_ are lesser than _cfg.alpha_ (0.025), we reject the null hypothesis for both the positive and negative directions.  
_Put informally_: **our way of labelling the conditions _does_ matter**

Let's have a look at the cluster corrected channel:

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/oslo2019/singleplot_t_cluster.png " width="650" %}
_Figure 7: Single channel plot - Cluster correction_

And here the three tested corrections are side by side

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/oslo2019/singleplots_side_by_side.png " width="650" %}  
_Figure 8: Single channel plot - corrections side by side_

We can also do topographical plots.  
Here are the three side by side at 168 ms

    n_plots = 3;
    figure('units', 'normalized', 'outerposition', [0 0 0.5 0.5]);
    stats = {stat_t stat_t_bonferroni stat_t_cluster};

    for plot_index = 1:n_plots

        stat = stats{plot_index};
        subplot(1, 3, plot_index)

        difference_wave.mask = stat.mask;

        cfg               = [];
        cfg.layout        = 'natmeg_customized_eeg1005.lay';
        cfg.maskparameter = 'mask';
        cfg.xlim          = [0.168 0.168];
        cfg.zlim          = [-4.5e-6 4.5e-6]; % Volts
        if plot_index > 1;
            cfg.comment   = 'no';
        end

        ft_topoplotER(cfg, difference_wave)

{% include markup/info %}
Do note that we, in EEG, most of the time do not make the inference at the level of the individual subject, but it is relevant to do so in for example diagnostic measurements.
{% include markup/end %}

We will now do a quick example of applying this to time-frequency data (TFR).

## Procedure for TFRs

Here, we'll just quickly show how to do within-subject statistics on TFRs

### Load the data

First, we'll load the data, both the ones with the trials and the ones with the average of the trials. We append the two trial data structures to one another using **[ft_appendfreq](/reference/ft_appendfreq)** and we calculate the difference between the two averages using **[ft_math](/reference/ft_math)**.

    load tfr_left_trials.mat
    load tfr_right_trials.mat
    load tfr_left.mat
    load tfr_right.mat

    cfg = [];

    tfr = ft_appendfreq(cfg, tfr_right_trials, tfr_left_trials);

    cfg = [];
    cfg.parameter    = 'powspctrm';
    cfg.operation    = '(x1-x2) / (x1+x2)';

    tfr_difference = ft_math(cfg, tfr_right, tfr_left);

We can see the sizes and ordering of dimensions using the in-built function _size_ and checking the _dimord_

    >> size(tfr.powspctrm)

    ans =

       110   128    20    26

    >> tfr.dimord

    ans =

    rpt_chan_freq_time

meaning that we have 110 trials on 128 channels at 20 frequencies and at 26 time points.  
For the difference between the averages, we have:

    >> size(tfr_difference.powspctrm)

    ans =

       128    20    26

    >> tfr_difference.dimord

    ans =

    chan_freq_time

meaning that we have a difference between averages on 128 channels at 20 frequencies and at 26 time points.

### Applying the tests

Note that we here apply the tests on the frequency range between 15 Hz and 30 Hz (the beta band range) and on the time interval between 400 ms and 1,000 ms (the time range of the beta rebound). This is set using _cfg.frequency_ and _cfg.latency_. We do this because we have _a priori_ knowledge that it is around here we should observe our beta rebound.

#### t-test with no correction

    cfg           = [];
    cfg.method    = 'analytic'; % using a parametric test
    cfg.statistic = 'ft_statfun_indepsamplesT'; % using independent samples
    cfg.correctm  = 'no'; % no multiple comparisons correction
    cfg.alpha     = 0.05;
    cfg.frequency = [15 30];
    cfg.latency   = [0.400 1.000];

    cfg.design    = zeros(1, length(tfr.trialinfo));
    cfg.design(tfr.trialinfo == 256)  = 1; % indicating which trials belong ...
    cfg.design(tfr.trialinfo == 4096) = 2; % to what category

    cfg.ivar      = 1; % indicating that the independent variable is found in ...
                       % first row of cfg.design

    stat_t_freq = ft_freqstatistics(cfg, tfr);

Note how the cluster correction seems to catch the clusters that "catch" our eyes, while not showing the many non-clustered values that the non-corrected _t-test_ showed. Also note that the Bonferroni correction removed all significant effects, showing that it is too conservative to apply to TFR data.

## Extending the frequency and time ranges of the tests

{% include markup/exercise %}
Do the three tests again without setting _cfg.frequency_ and _cfg.latency_ (you can comment them out)  
Compare with the plot below - why may it be important to use one's _prior_ knowledge?
