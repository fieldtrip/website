# FieldTrip workshop in Bern, Switzerland

- By whom: Maria Carla Piastra, Marios Antonakakis, Simon Homölle
- When: 29 August 2017
- Where: Pre-conference training courses at the BACI2017 conference in Bern <http://www.baci-conference.com>
- Local organization: Thomas König.

## How should you prepare for the workshop?

{% include markup/yellow %}
In this workshop we will have a steep learning curve. We will move from basic preprocessing to source-level analysis. Given the limited amount of time, it is **important** that you come well prepared.
{% include markup/end %}

If you are not familiar with MATLAB or are not certain about your MATLAB skills, please go through the "MATLAB for psychologists" tutorial on <http://www.antoniahamilton.com/matlab.html>

Please read the [FieldTrip reference paper](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2011/156869/) to understand the toolbox design.

In the first workshop hands-on session we will start with preprocessing EEG data, but will not spend too much time on understanding how MATLAB works and how FieldTrip organizes the data. Therefore if you have never done any FieldTrip analysis in MATLAB before, you should read this [introduction tutorial](/tutorial/introduction).
_We will start at 9:00 sharp and will finish around 17:30._

To get going, you need to start MATLAB. Then, you need to issue the following command

    restoredefaultpath
    cd <path_to_fieldtrip>
    addpath(pwd)
    ft_defaults

{% include markup/red %}
Please do NOT use the graphical path management tool from MATLAB. In this hands-on session we'll manage the path from the command line, but in general you are much better off using the startup.m file than the path GUI.

Please do NOT add FieldTrip with all subdirectories, subdirectories will be added automatically when needed, and only when needed.
{% include markup/end %}

The `restoredefaultpath` command clears your path, keeping only the official MATLAB toolboxes. The `addpath(pwd)` statement adds the present working directory, i.e. the directory containing the fieldtrip main functions. The `ft_defaults` command ensures that all required subdirectories are added to the path.

If you get the error "can't find the command ft_defaults" you should check the present working directory.

After installing FieldTrip to your path, you need to change into the hands-on specific directory, containing the data that is necessary to run the specific hands-on session. These folders are located in C:\\FieldTrip_workshop\\baci2017\\data.
