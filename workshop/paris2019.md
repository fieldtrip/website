# PracticalMEEG workshop at ICM in Paris

PracticalMEEG aims at providing an intensive several–days training to MEG and EEG analysts. It will provide its attendees with the ability to create a full analysis pipeline with exemplar (or their own) data in one or several of three leading software dedicated to MEG and EEG analysis (Brainstorm, FieldTrip and MNE-Python). More details can be found [here](http://practicalmeeg2019.org).

## Tutorial preparation

For the actual course, we will bring the required data and a recent FieldTrip version on a set of USB flash drives, to ensure that everybody will be up-and-running relatively quickly. **Please read the [USB instructions](/workshop/paris2019/usb_instructions) page carefully to copy the right files, and to unpack them properly on your computer.**

If you are doing these tutorials outside the practicalMEEG course, you should read on to get information about the FieldTrip software requirements and where you can get the data.

### Ensure that you have a recent version of FieldTrip on your computer

{% include markup/skyblue %}
For this workshop, we have created a set of dedicated tutorials, and fixed some small bugs in FieldTrip in order to get everything to run smoothly. Therefore, you should have a really recent version of the code, otherwise the tutorials will not run through without errors. Specifically, you need to have the code not 'older' than November 25, 2019.
{% include markup/end %}

You should start by getting an up-to-date copy of FieldTrip. This is best done through github, as is explained in detail in a dedicated [page](/development/git). The FieldTrip code and website are both maintained on [https://github.com/fieldtrip](https://github.com/fieldtrip).

{% include markup/skyblue %}
To quickly get access to the code, you would do the following from the command line or the equivalent in a graphical git interface, such as the [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip.git
```

This allows you to easily track the changes that we make to the code. If you also want to contribute back, please make an account on GitHub, fork `fieldtrip/fieldtrip` to your own account and read the aforementioned page.

{% include markup/end %}

Once FieldTrip is on your computer, the toolbox needs to be added to the MATLAB path. To achieve this, do the following:

- Change directory to the location of the FieldTrip package. Note the subfolders present.
- Add the FieldTrip folder to the path with

    addpath('path_to_fieldtrip')

Note: **do not** add the folder recursively, i.e., do not use `addpath(genpath('path_to_fieldtrip'))`.

- Run 'ft_defaults' in MATLAB.
- Confirm that FT has been successfully added to your path, for example by typing 'which ft_preprocessing' in Matlab; the correct path should be displayed.

### Get the example data that is used throughout this set of tutorials

The full dataset can be obtained from [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000117/versions/1.0.3), and has a size of about 460 GB. The pruned subset of the data that is needed for this collection of tutorials - and the results of running these tutorials - can be downloaded from our [download server](https://download.fieldtriptoolbox.org/workshop/paris2019/) and specifically in the `ds000117-pruned` folder. The results of the pipelines used in these tutorials are located in the `derivatives` folder.
