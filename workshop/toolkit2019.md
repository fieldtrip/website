# Advanced MEG/EEG toolkit at the Donders

On 8-12 April 2019 we will host the “Advanced MEG/EEG toolkit” at the Donders Institute in Nijmegen.

This intense 5-day toolkit course will teach you advanced MEG and EEG data analysis skills. Preprocessing, frequency analysis, source reconstruction, connectivity and various statistical methods will be covered. The toolkit will consist of a number of lectures, followed by hands-on sessions in which you will be tutored through the complete analysis of MEG and EEG data sets, and there will also be plenty of opportunity to interact and ask questions to us about your research and data. On the final day you will have the opportunity to work on your own dataset under supervision of the tutors.

Organizer: Robert Oostenveld, with the help of many colleagues.

Registration is closed.

## Getting started with the hands-on sessions

For the hands-on sessions we will use MATLAB R2016b, which you can start from the Windows menu. To ensure that everything runs smooth, we will work with a clean and well-tested version of FieldTrip that we have installed on all computers. Importantly, the tutorial data does not have to be downloaded but will also be distributed on the Windows computers under the `D:\toolkit2019` directory.

{% include markup/red %}
Please use MATLAB version 2016b when available. Only a few of the hands-on computers don't have version 2016b installed, please use the latest MATLAB version that is available on those.
