# ChildBrain pre-conference workshop in Leuven, Belgium

- By whom: Raul Granados, Simon Homölle
- When: Tuesday 5 February 2019
- Where: Pre-conference training courses at the ChildBrain conference in Leuven
- Local organization: Raul Granados.

## Program

| 09:00-09:15 | Welcome |
| 09:15-10:15 | Lecture |
| 10:15-10:30 | Coffee break |
| 10:45-12:00 | Hands on |

## How should you prepare for the workshop?

For the hands on session, we kindly require you to bring a functional laptop with MATLAB and FieldTrip installed. This session will be divided in a theoretical introduction, followed by the practical session, for which we ask you to read the points below:

- We expect that you know the basics of MATLAB and that you already have experience with MEG/EEG preprocessing and analysis.
- As the focus is on source reconstruction, topics that will NOT be covered in great detail are segmenting, artifact handling, averaging, frequency and time-frequency analysis, statistics.
- If you are not familiar with MATLAB or are not certain about your MATLAB skills, please go through the “MATLAB for psychologists” tutorial on <http://www.antoniahamilton.com/matlab.html>.
- To understand the FieldTrip toolbox design, please read the FieldTrip reference paper.
- We will not spend too much time on understanding how MATLAB works and how FieldTrip organizes the data. Therefore if you have never done any FieldTrip analysis in MATLAB before, you should read this introduction tutorial.

In the hands-on session we will start with preprocessing structural MRI data, but will not spend too much time on understanding how MATLAB works and how FieldTrip organizes the data. Therefore if you have never done any FieldTrip analysis in MATLAB before, you should read this [introduction tutorial](/tutorial/introduction).
_We will start at 9:00 sharp and will finish around 12:00._

## Setting up for the hands-on session

To get going, you need to start MATLAB. Then, you need to issue the following command

    restoredefaultpath
    cd <path_to_fieldtrip>
    addpath(pwd)
    ft_defaults

    global ft_default
    ft_default.spmversion = 'spm12';

{% include markup/red %}
Please do NOT use the graphical path management tool from MATLAB. In this hands-on session we'll manage the path from the command line, but in general you are much better off using the startup.m file than the path GUI.

Please do NOT add FieldTrip with all subdirectories, subdirectories will be added automatically when needed, and only when needed.
{% include markup/end %}

The `restoredefaultpath` command clears your path, keeping only the official MATLAB toolboxes. The `addpath(pwd)` statement adds the present working directory, i.e. the directory containing the FieldTrip main functions. The `ft_defaults` command ensures that all required subdirectories are added to the path. Setting the `spmversion` in the global `ft_default` variable ensures that all FieldTrip functions will use SPM12 rather than an older SPM version which sometimes causes issues with the mex files.

If you get the error "can't find the command ft_defaults" you should check the present working directory.

After installing FieldTrip to your path, you need to change into the hands-on specific directory, containing the data that is necessary to run the specific hands-on session. These folders are located in C:\\FieldTrip_workshop\\.

## Introduction

The aim of this tutorial is to create a head model of an adolescent with the numerical method of the Boundary Element Method (BEM), and if as an additional task with the Finite Element Method (FEM). The
[John E. Richards Lab](https://jerlab.sc.edu) provided us with an example MRI which consists of the averaged MRI of several 14 year old subjects.

## Background

{% include /shared/tutorial/sourcelocalization_background.md %}

## Procedure

As already mentioned, the goal of this session is to solve the EEG forward problem, more precisely we want to compute EEG leadfields so that the inverse problem can be solved.
In order to compute leadfields, there are 9 main steps that have to be followed.

1.  Load and read the anatomical data (**[ft_read_mri](/reference/fileio/ft_read_mri)**);
2.  Align the MRI to the CTF coordinates. (**[ft_volumerealign](/reference/ft_volumerealign)**);
3.  Reslice the MRI image so that the voxels of the anatomical data are homogeneous (i.e. the size of the voxel is the same into each direction). This step will facilitate the segmentation step. (**[ft_volumereslice](/reference/ft_volumereslice)**)
4.  Segment the MRI: 3 compartments (scalp, skull, brain) (**[ft_volumesegment](/reference/ft_volumesegment)**);
5.  then we create the mesh: triangulated surface mesh for BEM and hexahedral volume mesh for FEM (**[ft_prepare_mesh](/reference/ft_prepare_mesh)**).
6.  Create the head models (headmodel_bem) where geometrical and electrical information are merged together (**[ft_prepare_headmodel](/reference/ft_prepare_headmodel)**);
7.  Align the electrodes to the head surface (**[ft_electroderealign](/reference/ft_electroderealign)**);
8.  The source model is created, where the location of the sources is restrained to the brain compartment (from the BEM mesh) (**[ft_prepare_sourcemodel](/reference/ft_prepare_sourcemodel)**);
9.  Leadfields can be computed (**[ft_prepare_leadfield](/reference/ft_prepare_leadfield)**).

### 1. Read the MRI

First of all we have to load the data

    mri_orig = ft_read_mri('ANTS14-0Years3T_head_bias_corrected.nii');

Visualize the MRI

    cfg = [];
    ft_sourceplot(cfg,mri_orig);

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/leuven2019/mri_orig.png" width="700" %}
_Figure 2: Visualization of the MRI_

### 2. Realign the MRI

In this step we will interactively align the MRI to the CTF space. We will be asked to identify the three CTF landmarks + zpoint (nasion, NAS; right pre-auricular point, RPA; left pre-auricular point, LPA) in the MRI. The zpoint is a point in the upper part of the head, it only serves to make sure that coordinate system is not upside down. It is important that all geometrical is expressed in the same coordinate system. This helps for coregistration of these data.

    cfg = [];
    cfg.method   = 'interactive';
    cfg.coordsys = 'ctf';
    mri_realigned = ft_volumerealign(cfg, mri_orig);

We can visualize the realigned MRI

    cfg = [];
    ft_sourceplot(cfg, mri_realigned);

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/leuven2019/mri_realigned.png" width="700" %}
_Figure 3: Visualization of the realigned MRI_

### 3. Reslice the MRI

Before we segment the MRI, we will first reslice the MRI. The reason why is that a segmentation works properly when the voxels of the anatomical images are homogenous.

    cfg = [];
    mri_resliced = ft_volumereslice(cfg, mri_realigned);

We can visualize the resliced MRI

    cfg = [];
    ft_sourceplot(cfg, mri_resliced);

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/leuven2019/mri_resliced.png" width="700" %}
_Figure 3: Visualization of the realigned MRI_

### 4. Segment the MRI

Now we can segment the 3 different tissues we are interested in for our head model

    cfg = [];
    cfg.output = {'brain','skull', 'scalp'};
    mri_segmented_3_compartment = ft_volumesegment(cfg, mri_resliced);

    save mri_segmented_3_compartment mri_segmented_3_compartment

Visualize the segmentation

    seg_i = ft_datatype_segmentation(mri_segmented_3_compartment,'segmentationstyle','indexed');

    cfg = [];
    cfg.funparameter = 'seg';
    cfg.funcolormap  = gray(4); % distinct color per tissue
    cfg.location     = 'center';
    cfg.atlas        = seg_i;
    ft_sourceplot(cfg, seg_i);

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/leuven2019/mri_segmented_bem.png" width="700" %}

_Figure 4: 3 compartment segmentation output_

### 5. Create the mesh

On the basis of the segmentation we can now create a geometrical description of the head as a mesh

    cfg = [];
    cfg.tissue      = {'brain','skull','scalp'};
    cfg.numvertices = [3000 2000 1000];
    mesh_bem = ft_prepare_mesh(cfg,mri_segmented_3_compartment);

Visualize the mesh

    figure, ft_plot_mesh(mesh_bem(1),'surfaceonly','yes','vertexcolor','none','facecolor',...
               'skin','facealpha',0.5,'edgealpha',0.1)
    ft_plot_mesh(mesh_bem(2),'surfaceonly','yes','vertexcolor','none','facecolor',...
               'skin','facealpha',0.5,'edgealpha',0.1)
    ft_plot_mesh(mesh_bem(3),'surfaceonly','yes','vertexcolor','none','facecolor',...
               'skin','facealpha',0.5,'edgealpha',0.1)

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/leuven2019/mesh_bem.png" width="700" %}
_Figure 5: 3 compartment mesh with electrodes_

### 6. Create the head model

Now we are ready and to create the a head model on the basis of the mesh.

    cfg = [];
    cfg.method = 'dipoli'; % You can also specify 'bemcp', or another method.
    headmodel_bem = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, mesh_bem);

{% include markup/red %}
In Windows the method 'dipoli' does not work. You can explore other BEM method like 'bemcp'. If you use 'bemcp', the conductivity field has a different order: {'brain', 'skull', 'skin'}.
{% include markup/end %}

### 7. Align the electrodes

First we have to load a suitable electrode set. For this tutorial we will load a template dataset and transform it in such a way that it will fit the head surface.

    elec = ft_read_sens('standard_1020.elc');

And now we will fit it to the head surface.

    cfg = [];
    cfg.method    = 'interactive';
    cfg.elec      = elec;
    cfg.headshape = headmodel_bem.bnd(3);
    elec = ft_electroderealign(cfg);

Check the alignment visually.

    figure;
    ft_plot_axes(mesh_bem(1))
    hold on;
    ft_plot_mesh(mesh_bem,'surfaceonly','yes','vertexcolor','none','facecolor',...
               'skin','facealpha',0.5,'edgealpha',0.1)
    ft_plot_sens(elec,'style', '.k');

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/leuven2019/aligned.png" width="700" %}

### 8. Create the source model

Before we are able to create the leadfields

    cfg = [];
    cfg.resolution = 7.5;
    cfg.threshold       = 0.1;
    cfg.smooth          = 5;
    cfg.headmodel       = headmodel_bem;
    cfg.inwardshift     = 1; % shifts dipoles away from surfaces
    sourcemodel = ft_prepare_sourcemodel(cfg, headmodel_bem);

Visualize the source model

    figure, ft_plot_mesh(sourcemodel.pos(sourcemodel.inside,:))
    hold on, ft_plot_mesh(mesh_bem(1),'surfaceonly','yes','vertexcolor','none','facecolor',...
               'skin','facealpha',0.5,'edgealpha',0.1)

{% include image src="/assets/img/workshop/leuven2019/sourcemodel_all.png" width="700" %}
_Figure 7: Sourcemodel on the brain compartment_

Save the source model

save sourcemodel sourcemodel;

### 9. Compute the leadfield

We will now compute the lead field for every source in the source model.

    cfg = [];
    cfg.grid = sourcemodel;
    cfg.headmodel  = headmodel_bem;
    cfg.elec = elec;
    leadfield_bem = ft_prepare_leadfield(cfg);

This is the last step for creating a forward model. We could now use the lead fields of each source to do the inverse modeling!

### 10. Further tasks

#### Exercise 1

{% include markup/skyblue %}
So far we only created a BEM volume conduction model. To create a FEM volume conduction model use the same steps as beforehand.
{% include markup/end %}

Change Step 5 into

    cfg = [];
    cfg.tissue = {'brain','skull','scalp'};
    cfg.method = 'hexahedral';
    mesh_fem = ft_prepare_mesh(cfg,mri_segmented_3_compartment);

and Step 6 into

    cfg = [];
    cfg.method = 'simbio'; % Unfortunately this is not available on Windows.
    headmodel_bem = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, mesh_bem);

#### Exercise 2

{% include markup/skyblue %}
You can also find the segmentation 'AVG14-0Years3T_segmented_BEM3.mat' to create a head model. This a segmentation is processed version of a segmentation provided by alongside the MRI in the Neurodevelopmental MRI Database from the [John E. Richards Lab](https://jerlab.sc.edu). The segmentation was already preprocessed with the Steps 1-4.
{% include markup/end %}

## Summary and Comments

This tutorial was about the creation of a volume conduction model on the basis of averaged MRIs of 14 year old subjects, creation of a source model, and computation of the lead fields. This head model could subsequently be used for source level analysis.
