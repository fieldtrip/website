```plaintext
 FT_DIPOLESIMULATION simulates channel-level time-series data that consists of the
 the spatial distribution of the the field or potential of one or multiple dipoles.

 Use as
   data = ft_dipolesimulation(cfg)
 which will return a raw data structure that resembles the output of
 FT_PREPROCESSING.

 The dipoles position and orientation have to be specified with
   cfg.dip.pos     = [Rx Ry Rz] (size Nx3)
   cfg.dip.mom     = [Qx Qy Qz] (size 3xN)

 The number of trials and the time axes of the trials can be specified by
   cfg.fsample    = simulated sample frequency (default = 1000)
   cfg.trllen     = length of simulated trials in seconds (default = 1)
   cfg.numtrl     = number of simulated trials (default = 10)
   cfg.baseline   = number (default = 0.3)
 or by
   cfg.time       = cell-array with one time axis per trial, for example obtained from an existing dataset

 The timecourse of the dipole activity is given as a cell-array with one
 dipole signal per trial
   cfg.dip.signal     = cell-array with one dipole signal per trial
 or by specifying the parameters of a sine-wave signal
   cfg.dip.frequency  =   in Hz
   cfg.dip.phase      =   in radians
   cfg.dip.amplitude  =   per dipole

 Random white noise can be added to the data in each trial, either by
 specifying an absolute or a relative noise level
   cfg.relnoise    = add noise with level relative to data signal
   cfg.absnoise    = add noise with absolute level
   cfg.randomseed  = 'yes' or a number or vector with the seed value (default = 'yes')

 Optional input arguments are
   cfg.channel    = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels (default = 'all'),
                    see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
   cfg.dipoleunit = units for dipole amplitude (default nA*m)
   cfg.chanunit   = units for the channel data

 Optionally, you can modify the leadfields by reducing the rank, i.e. remove the weakest orientation
   cfg.reducerank    = 'no', or number (default = 3 for EEG, 2 for MEG)
   cfg.backproject   = 'yes' or 'no',  determines when reducerank is applied whether the 
                       lower rank leadfield is projected back onto the original linear 
                       subspace, or not (default = 'yes')

 The volume conduction model of the head should be specified as
   cfg.headmodel     = structure with volume conduction model, see FT_PREPARE_HEADMODEL

 The EEG or MEG sensor positions should be specified as
   cfg.elec          = structure with electrode positions or filename, see FT_READ_SENS
   cfg.grad          = structure with gradiometer definition or filename, see FT_READ_SENS
