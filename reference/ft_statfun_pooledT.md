```plaintext
 FT_STATFUN_POOLEDT computes the pooled t-value over a number of replications. The
 idea behind this function is that you first (prior to calling this function)
 compute a contrast between two conditions per subject, and that subsequently you
 test this over subjects using random sign-flipping.

 Use this function by calling one of the high-level statistics functions as
   [stat] = ft_timelockstatistics(cfg, timelock1, timelock2, ...)
   [stat] = ft_freqstatistics(cfg, freq1, freq2, ...)
   [stat] = ft_sourcestatistics(cfg, source1, source2, ...)
 with the following configuration option
   cfg.statistic = 'ft_statfun_pooledT'

 The expected values for the pooled-t, which is zero according to H0, have to be
 passed as pseudo-values. The subject-specific t-values will be randomly swapped with
 the pseudo-values and the difference is computed; in effect this implements random
 sign-flipping.

 The randimization distribution (with optional clustering) of the randomly
 sign-flipped pooled-t values is computed and used for statistical inference.

 Note that, although the output of this function is to be interpreted as a
 fixed-effects statistic, the statistical inference based on the comparison of the
 observed pooled t-values with the randomization distribution is not a fixed-effect
 statistic, one or a few outlier will cause the randomization distribution to
 broaden and result in the conclusion of "not significant".

 The experimental design is specified as:
   cfg.ivar  = independent variable, row number of the design that contains the labels of the conditions to be sign-flipped (default=1)

 The labels independent variable should be specified as the number 1 for the
 observed t-values and 2 for the pseudo-values.
