title: ft_artifact_clip

```plaintext
 FT_ARTIFACT_CLIP scans the data segments of interest for channels that clip, i.,e.
 channels that have a constant value for a prolonged time, often indicating that the
 signal was outside the range for the amplifier. These clipping artifacts are
 detected by the signal being completely flat for a given amount of time.

 Use as
   [cfg, artifact] = ft_artifact_clip(cfg)
 with the configuration options
   cfg.dataset     = string with the filename
 or
   cfg.headerfile  = string with the filename
   cfg.datafile    = string with the filename
 and optionally
   cfg.headerformat
   cfg.dataformat

 Alternatively you can use it as
   [cfg, artifact] = ft_artifact_clip(cfg, data)
 where the input data is a structure as obtained from FT_PREPROCESSING.

 In both cases the configuration should also contain
   cfg.trl         = structure that defines the data segments of interest, see FT_DEFINETRIAL
   cfg.continuous  = 'yes' or 'no' whether the file contains continuous data (default is automatic)
 and
   cfg.artfctdef.clip.channel       = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
   cfg.artfctdef.clip.pretim        = pre-artifact rejection interval in seconds (default = 0)
   cfg.artfctdef.clip.psttim        = post-artifact rejection interval in seconds (default = 0)
   cfg.artfctdef.clip.timethreshold = number, minimum duration in seconds of a segment with consecutive identical samples to be considered as 'clipped'
   cfg.artfctdef.clip.amplthreshold = number, minimum amplitude difference in consecutive samples to be considered as 'clipped' (default = 0)
                                      string, percent of the amplitude range considered as 'clipped' (i.e. '1%')

 The output argument "artifact" is a Nx2 matrix comparable to the "trl" matrix of
 FT_DEFINETRIAL. The first column of which specifying the beginsamples of an
 artifact period, the second column contains the endsamples of the artifactperiods.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing, you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
 to read the input data from a *.mat file on disk. This mat files should contain
 only a single variable named 'data', corresponding to the input structure.
