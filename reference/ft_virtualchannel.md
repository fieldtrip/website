 FT_VIRTUALCHANNEL creates virtual channel data, combining numeric data from a data
 structure defined at the channel level with spatial filter information from a
 source data structure, and optional parcellation information.

 Use as
    output = ft_virtualchannel(cfg, data, source)
 or
    output = ft_virtualchannel(cfg, data, source, parcellation)

 where the input "data" is a channel-level data structure that can be linearly
 mapped onto the virtual channel level, e.g. a raw data structure obtained with
 FT_PREPROCESSING, a timelock structure, obtained with FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS, or a
 freq structure with fourierspectra, obtained with FT_FREQANALYSIS.

 The input "source" is a source structure that has been obtained with
 FT_SOURCEANALYSIS, and which contains spatial filter information for at least one
 dipole location, in the source.filter, or source.avg.filter field.

 The optional input "parcellation" is described in detail in
 FT_DATATYPE_PARCELLATION (2-D) or FT_DATATYPE_SEGMENTATION (3-D) and can be
 obtained from FT_READ_ATLAS or from a custom parcellation/segmentation for your
 individual subject. Alternatively, the input "source" can already contain a
 parcellation.

 The configuration "cfg" is a structure that should either contain
   cfg.pos           = Nx3 matrix containing the dipole positions for the virtual
                       channel(s). These positions should match the entries in
                       the source.pos field. (default = [])
 or
   cfg.parcellation  = string, name of the field that is used for the
                       parcel labels. (default = [])
   cfg.parcel        = string, or cell-array of strings, specifying for which
                       parcels to return the output. (default = 'all')

 Moreover, the cfg structure can contain
   cfg.method        = string, determines how the components of the specified virtual
                       channel(s) are to to be combined. 'svd' (default), 'none', 'pca',
                       'runica', 'fastica', 'dss'.
   cfg.numcomponent  = scalar (or 'all'), determines the number of components per virtual
                       channel in the output. (default = 1)
