 FT_SOURCEINTERPOLATE interpolates source activity or statistical maps onto the
 voxels or vertices of an anatomical description of the brain.  Both the functional
 and the anatomical data can either describe a volumetric 3D regular grid, a
 triangulated description of the cortical sheet or an arbitrary cloud of points.

 The functional data in the output data will be interpolated at the locations at
 which the anatomical data are defined. For example, if the anatomical data was
 volumetric, the output data is a volume-structure, containing the resliced source
 and the anatomical volume that can be visualized using FT_SOURCEPLOT or written to
 file using FT_SOURCEWRITE.

 The following scenarios can be considered:

 - Both functional data and anatomical data are defined on 3D regular grids, for
   example with a low-res grid for the functional data and a high-res grid for the
   anatomy.

 - The functional data is defined on a 3D regular grid and the anatomical data is
   defined on an irregular point cloud, which can be a 2D triangulated surface mesh.

 - The functional data is defined on an irregular point cloud, which can be a 2D
   triangulated surface mesh, and the anatomical data is defined on a 3D regular grid.

 - Both the functional and the anatomical data are defined on an irregular point
   cloud, which can be a 2D triangulated mesh.

 - The functional data is defined on a low-resolution 2D triangulated surface mesh and the
   anatomical data is defined on a high-resolution 2D triangulated surface mesh, where the
   low-res vertices form a subset of the high-res vertices. This allows for mesh-based
   interpolation. The algorithm currently implemented is so-called 'smudging' as it is
   also applied by the MNE-suite software.

 Use as
   [interp] = ft_sourceinterpolate(cfg, source, anatomy)
   [interp] = ft_sourceinterpolate(cfg, stat,   anatomy)
 where
   source  is the output of FT_SOURCEANALYSIS
   stat    is the output of FT_SOURCESTATISTICS
   anatomy is the output of FT_READ_MRI, or one of the FT_VOLUMExxx functions,
           or a cortical sheet that was read with FT_READ_HEADSHAPE,
           or a regular 3D grid created with FT_PREPARE_SOURCEMODEL.

 The configuration should contain:
   cfg.parameter     = string or cell-array with the functional parameter(s) to be interpolated
   cfg.downsample    = integer number (default = 1, i.e. no downsampling)
   cfg.interpmethod  = string, can be 'nearest', 'linear', 'cubic',  'spline', 'sphere_avg', 'sphere_weighteddistance', or 'smudge' (default = 'linear for interpolating two 3D volumes, 'nearest' for all other cases)

 For interpolating two 3D regular grids or volumes onto each other the supported
 interpolation methods are 'nearest', 'linear', 'cubic' or 'spline'. For all other
 cases the supported interpolation methods are 'nearest', 'sphere_avg',
 'sphere_weighteddistance' or 'smudge'.

 The functional and anatomical data should be expressed in the same
 coordinate sytem, i.e. either both in MEG headcoordinates (NAS/LPA/RPA)
 or both in SPM coordinates (AC/PC).

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
