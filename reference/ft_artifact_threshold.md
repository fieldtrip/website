```plaintext
 FT_ARTIFACT_THRESHOLD scans data segments of interest for channels in which the
 signal exceeds a specified minimum or maximum value, or in which the peak-to-peak
 range within the trial exceeds a specified threshold.

 Use as
   [cfg, artifact] = ft_artifact_threshold(cfg)
 with the configuration options
   cfg.dataset     = string with the filename
 or
   cfg.headerfile  = string with the filename
   cfg.datafile    = string with the filename
 and optionally
   cfg.headerformat
   cfg.dataformat

 Alternatively you can use it as
   [cfg, artifact] = ft_artifact_threshold(cfg, data)
 where the input data is a structure as obtained from FT_PREPROCESSING.

 In both cases the configuration should also contain
   cfg.trl        = structure that defines the data segments of interest, see FT_DEFINETRIAL
   cfg.continuous = 'yes' or 'no' whether the file contains continuous data
 and
   cfg.artfctdef.threshold.channel   = cell-array with channel labels
   cfg.artfctdef.threshold.bpfilter  = 'no' or 'yes' (default = 'yes')
   cfg.artfctdef.threshold.bpfreq    = [0.3 30]
   cfg.artfctdef.threshold.bpfiltord = 4

 In the same way as specifying the options for band-pass filtering, it is also
 possible to specify lpfilter, hpfilter, bsfilter, dftfilter or medianfilter, see
 FT_PREPROCESSING.

 The detection of artifacts is done according to the following settings,
 you should specify at least one of these thresholds
   cfg.artfctdef.threshold.min       = value in uV or T, default -inf
   cfg.artfctdef.threshold.max       = value in uV or T, default  inf
   cfg.artfctdef.threshold.onset     = value in uV or T, default  inf
   cfg.artfctdef.threshold.offset    = value in uV or T, default  inf

 When cfg.artfctdef.threshold.onset and offset are used, the rising and falling
 flank are thresholded with different values. In case onset and offset are both
 positive, the data will be thresholded above their values. In case both onset and
 offset are negative, the data will be thresholded below their values.

 Note that this function does not support artifactpadding or filterpadding.

 The output argument "artifact" is a Nx2 matrix comparable to the "trl" matrix of
 FT_DEFINETRIAL. The first column of which specifying the beginsamples of an
 artifact period, the second column contains the endsamples of the artifactperiods.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing, you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
 to read the input data from a *.mat file on disk. This mat files should contain
 only a single variable named 'data', corresponding to the input structure.
