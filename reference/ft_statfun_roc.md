 FT_STATFUN_ROC computes the area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operator
 Characteristic (ROC). This is a measure of the separability of the data observed in
 two conditions. The AUC can be used for statistical testing whether the two
 conditions can be distinguished on the basis of the data.

 Use this function by calling one of the high-level statistics functions as
   [stat] = ft_timelockstatistics(cfg, timelock1, timelock2, ...)
   [stat] = ft_freqstatistics(cfg, freq1, freq2, ...)
   [stat] = ft_sourcestatistics(cfg, source1, source2, ...)
 with the following configuration option
   cfg.statistic = 'ft_statfun_roc'

 The experimental design is specified as:
   cfg.ivar  = independent variable, row number of the design that contains the labels of the conditions to be compared (default=1)

 The labels for the independent variable should be specified as the number 1 and 2.

 Note that this statfun performs a one sided test in which condition "1" is assumed
 to be larger than condition "2". This function does not compute an analytic
 probability of condition "1" being larger than condition "2", but can be used in a
 randomization test, including clustering.

 A low-level example with 10 channel-time-frequency points and 1000 observations per
 condition goes like this:
   dat1 = randn(10,1000) + 1;
   dat2 = randn(10,1000);
   design = [1*ones(1,1000) 2*ones(1,1000)];
   stat = ft_statfun_roc([], [dat1 dat2], design);
