 FT_STATFUN_BAYESFACTOR computes the Bayes factor for a H0 of the data in two
 conditions having the same mean, versus H1 of the data having different means. This
 function supports both unpaired and paired designs and assumes flat priors.

 Lee and Wagenmakers (2013) provide these guidelines for its interpretation
   IF B10 IS...    THEN YOU HAVE...
     > 100           Extreme evidence for H1
     30 – 100        Very strong evidence for H1
     10 – 30         Strong evidence for H1
     3 – 10          Moderate evidence for H1
     1 – 3           Anecdotal evidence for H1
     1               No evidence
     1/3 – 1         Anecdotal evidence for H0
     1/3 – 1/10      Moderate evidence for H0
     1/10 – 1/30     Strong evidence for H0
     1/30 – 1/100    Very strong evidence for H0
     < 1/100         Extreme evidence for H0

 Use this function by calling one of the high-level statistics functions as
   [stat] = ft_timelockstatistics(cfg, timelock1, timelock2, ...)
   [stat] = ft_freqstatistics(cfg, freq1, freq2, ...)
   [stat] = ft_sourcestatistics(cfg, source1, source2, ...)
 with the following configuration option:
   cfg.statistic = 'ft_statfun_bayesfactor'

 The experimental design is specified as:
   cfg.ivar  = independent variable, row number of the design that contains the labels of the conditions to be compared (default=1)
   cfg.uvar  = optional, row number of design that contains the labels of the units-of-observation, i.e. subjects or trials (default=2)

 The labels for the independent variable should be specified as the number 1 and 2.
 The labels for the unit of observation should be integers ranging from 1 to the
 total number of observations (subjects or trials).

 The cfg.uvar option is only needed for paired data, you should leave it empty
 for non-paired data.
