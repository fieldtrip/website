title: ft_write_event
---
```plaintext
 FT_WRITE_EVENT writes an event structure to a file, a message daemon listening on a
 network socked, or to another computer connected through the serial port. Note that
 this function is mostly for real-time streaming of events. For most data files on
 disk the writing of events is done simultaneously with the header and data in
 FT_WRITE_DATA.

 Use as
   ft_write_event(filename, event, ...)

 The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is a
 structure with the event. Multiple events can be represented as a structure array.
 Events are represented in the same format as those returned by FT_READ_EVENT.
   event.type      = string
   event.sample    = expressed in samples, the first sample of a recording is 1
   event.value     = number or string
   event.offset    = expressed in samples
   event.duration  = expressed in samples
   event.timestamp = expressed in timestamp units, which vary over systems (optional)

 Additional options should be specified in key-value pairs and can be
   'eventformat'  = string, see below
   'append'       = boolean, not supported for all formats

 Events can be written to special communication streams by specifying the target as
 URI instead of a filename. Supported are
   buffer://<host>:<port>
   fifo://<filename>
   tcp://<host>:<port>
   udp://<host>:<port>
   mysql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>
   rfb://<password>@<host>:<port>
   serial:<port>?key1=value1&key2=value2&...
   rfb://<password>@<host>:<port>
