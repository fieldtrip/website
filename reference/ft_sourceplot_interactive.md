 FT_SOURCEPLOT_INTERACTIVE provides a rapid way to plot 3D surface
 renderings of pos_time or pos_freq functional data, and interactively
 explore them. One figure is created with surface plots of the individual
 conditions, and by default a plot of the functional data averaged over
 the entire cortex is created over time (or frequency). Users can click in
 the line graph to shift the time point for which the functional data is
 shown in the surface plots. Additionally, users can Shift+Click in the
 surface plots to add a "virtual electrode", for which a new line graph
 figure will be created.

 Input data needs to be source+mesh, so has to contain a tri, pos, and one
 functional field plus a time- or frequency axis.

 Use e.g. like so:

 cfg = [];
 cfg.data_labels = {'Congruent', 'Incongruent'};
 ft_sourceplot_interactive(cfg, sourceFC, sourceFIC);

 Configuration options (all optional) include:
   cfg.parameter       = string, functional parameter to plot. Default = 'pow'.
   cfg.data_labels     = cell array of strings, describing each data input argument. Default =
                         {'Input 1',...,'Input N'}
   cfg.time_label      = string, xlabel for line graphs of functional data. Default = 'Time
                         (s)' for data with time dimension, 'Frequency (Hz)' for data with
                         freq dimension.
   cfg.pow_label       = string, ylabel for line graphs of functional data. Default = 'Current
                         density (a.u.)'.
   cfg.clim            = 2-element numeric vector, color limits for surface plots. Default = 
                         [0 max(data)*0.75], and [-max(data)*0.75, max(data)*0.75] for an
                         optional last functional input argument reflecting a difference score
                         (see 'has_diff' option below).
   cfg.has_diff        = 1x1 logical, default = false. If true, this function will treat the
                         last data input argument slightly differently from the ones before
                         it, which is useful in case you wish to plot a difference score in
                         addition to two per-condition current densities. Specifically, if
                         true, (1) the line plots generated by this function will not include
                         the last data input argument; and (2) the colours limits for the
                         surface plot corresponding to the last data input argument will be
                         set symmetrically around zero (if cfg.clim is left empty - see
                         above).
   cfg.atlas           = string, filename of an atlas to use in generating title strings for
                         the line graphs corresponding to 'virtual electrodes' placed on the
                         surface plots. Atlas must be in the coordinate system of the
                         specified data input arguments. See FT_READ_ATLAS.
