```plaintext
 FT_STATISTICS_CROSSVALIDATE performs cross-validation using a prespecified
 multivariate analysis. This function should not be called directly, instead you
 should call the function that is associated with the type of data on which you want
 to perform the test.

 Use as
   stat = ft_timelockstatistics(cfg, data1, data2, data3, ...)
   stat = ft_freqstatistics    (cfg, data1, data2, data3, ...)
   stat = ft_sourcestatistics  (cfg, data1, data2, data3, ...)

 where the data is obtained from FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS, FT_FREQANALYSIS or
 FT_SOURCEANALYSIS respectively, or from FT_TIMELOCKGRANDAVERAGE,
 FT_FREQGRANDAVERAGE or FT_SOURCEGRANDAVERAGE respectively 
 and with cfg.method = 'crossvalidate'

 The configuration options that can be specified are:
   cfg.mva           = a multivariate analysis (default = {dml.standardizer dml.svm})
   cfg.statistic     = a cell-array of statistics to report (default = {'accuracy' 'binomial'})
   cfg.nfolds        = number of cross-validation folds (default = 5)
   cfg.resample      = true/false; upsample less occurring classes during
                       training and downsample often occurring classes
                       during testing (default = false)

 This returns:
   stat.statistic = the statistics to report
   stat.model     = the models associated with this multivariate analysis
