```plaintext
 FT_STATFUN_MEAN demonstrates how to compute the mean over all conditions in the
 data. Since this does NOT depend on the experimental design, it cannot be used for
 testing for differences between conditions.

 This function serves as an example for a statfun. You can use such a function with
 the statistical framework in FieldTrip using FT_TIMELOCKSTATISTICS,
 FT_FREQSTATISTICS or FT_SOURCESTATISTICS to perform a statistical test, without
 having to worry about the representation of the data.

 See also FT_TIMELOCKSTATISTICS, FT_FREQSTATISTICS or FT_SOURCESTATISTICS, and see FT_STATFUN_DIFF for a similar example
