```plaintext
 FT_HEARTRATE estimates the heart rate from a continuous PPG or ECG channel. It
 returns a new data structure with a continuous representation of the heartrate in
 beats per minute, the heart period (i.e., the RR interval) in seconds per interval,
 the heartbeat phase and the moment of the heartbeat onsets.

 Use as
   dataout = ft_heartrate(cfg, data)
 where the input data is a structure as obtained from FT_PREPROCESSING and the
 output is a similar structure with the same trials and time-charactersitics, but
 with new channels describing the heart rate parameters.

 The configuration structure has the following general options
   cfg.channel          = selected channel for processing, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION
   cfg.feedback         = 'yes' or 'no'
   cfg.method           = string representing the method for heart beat detection
                          'findpeaks'  filtering and normalization, followed by FINDPEAKS (default)
                          'pantompkin' implementation of the Pan-Tompkin algorithm for ECG beat detection

 For the 'findpeaks' method the following additional options can be specified
   cfg.envelopewindow   = scalar, time in seconds (default = 10)
   cfg.peakseparation   = scalar, time in seconds
   cfg.threshold        = scalar, usually between 0 and 1 (default = 0.4)
   cfg.flipsignal       = 'yes' or 'no', whether to flip the polarity of the signal (default is automatic)
 and the data can be preprocessed on the fly using
   cfg.preproc.bpfilter = 'yes' or 'no'
   cfg.preproc.bpfreq   = [low high], filter frequency in Hz
 This implementation performs some filtering and amplitude normalization, followed
 by the FINDPEAKS function. It works both for ECG as for PPG signals.

 For the 'pantompkin` method there are no additional options. This implements

 You can correct ectopic beats using the following options
   cfg.ectopicbeatcorrect   = 'yes' or 'no', replace a single ectopic beat (default = 'no')
   cfg.ectopicbeatthreshold = fractional number as percentage (default = 0.2

 An ectopic beat is a premature ventricual contraction, causing a very short-lived
 increase in the variability in the rate. This can be corrected by replacing it with
 a beat that falls exactly in between its neighbouring beats. A beat is detected as
 ectopic if the RR-interval of a beat is 20% (default) smaller than the previous
 beat-to-beat interval and is followed by an interval that is 20% (default) larger
 (i.e. refractory period). The default threshold of 0.2 can be modified with
 cfg.ectopicbeatthreshold.
