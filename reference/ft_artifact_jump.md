 FT_ARTIFACT_JUMP scans data segments of interest for SQUID jump artifacts.

 Use as
   [cfg, artifact] = ft_artifact_jump(cfg)
 with the configuration options
   cfg.dataset    = string with the filename
 or
   cfg.headerfile = string with the filename
   cfg.datafile   = string with the filename
 and optionally
   cfg.headerformat
   cfg.dataformat

 Alternatively you can use it as
   [cfg, artifact] = ft_artifact_jump(cfg, data)
 where the input data is a structure as obtained from FT_PREPROCESSING.

 In both cases the configuration should also contain
   cfg.trl        = structure that defines the data segments of interest, see FT_DEFINETRIAL
   cfg.continuous = 'yes' or 'no' whether the file contains continuous data

 Prior to artifact detection, the data is preprocessed (again) with the following
 configuration parameters, which are optimal for identifying SQUID jump artifacts.
   cfg.artfctdef.jump.medianfilter  = 'yes'
   cfg.artfctdef.jump.medianfiltord = 9
   cfg.artfctdef.jump.absdiff       = 'yes'

 Artifacts are identified by means of thresholding the z-transformed value
 of the preprocessed data.
   cfg.artfctdef.jump.channel       = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
   cfg.artfctdef.jump.cutoff        = z-value at which to threshold (default = 20)
   cfg.artfctdef.jump.trlpadding    = number in seconds (default = 0.0)
   cfg.artfctdef.jump.fltpadding    = number in seconds (default = 0.0)
   cfg.artfctdef.jump.artpadding    = number in seconds (default = 0.0)

 The output argument "artifact" is a Nx2 matrix comparable to the "trl" matrix of
 FT_DEFINETRIAL. The first column of which specifying the beginsamples of an
 artifact period, the second column contains the endsamples of the artifactperiods.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing, you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
 to read the input data from a *.mat file on disk. This mat files should contain
 only a single variable named 'data', corresponding to the input structure.
