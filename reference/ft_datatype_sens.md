 FT_DATATYPE_SENS describes the FieldTrip structure that represents an MEG, EEG,
 sEEG, ECoG, or NIRS sensor array. This structure is commonly called "grad" for MEG,
 "elec" for EEG and intranial EEG, "opto" for NIRS, or in general "sens" if it could
 be any one.

 For all sensor types a distinction should be made between the channel (i.e. the
 output of the transducer that is A/D converted) and the sensor, which may have some
 spatial extent. For example in MEG gradiometers are comprised of multiple coils and
 with EEG you can have a bipolar channel, where the position of the channel can be
 represented as in between the position of the two electrodes.

 The structure for MEG gradiometers and/or magnetometers contains
    sens.label      = Mx1 cell-array with channel labels
    sens.chanpos    = Mx3 matrix with channel positions
    sens.chanori    = Mx3 matrix with channel orientations, used for synthetic planar gradient computation
    sens.coilpos    = Nx3 matrix with coil positions
    sens.coilori    = Nx3 matrix with coil orientations
    sens.tra        = MxN matrix to combine coils into channels
    sens.balance    = structure containing info about the balancing, See FT_APPLY_MONTAGE
 and optionally
    sens.chanposold = Mx3 matrix with original channel positions (in case sens.chanpos has been updated to contain NaNs, e.g. after FT_COMPONENTANALYSIS)
    sens.chanoriold = Mx3 matrix with original channel orientations
    sens.labelold   = Mx1 cell-array with original channel labels

 The structure for EEG, sEEG or ECoG channels contains
    sens.label      = Mx1 cell-array with channel labels
    sens.chanpos    = Mx3 matrix with channel positions (often the same as electrode positions)
    sens.elecpos    = Nx3 matrix with electrode positions
    sens.tra        = MxN matrix to combine electrodes into channels
 In case sens.tra is not present in the EEG sensor array, the channels
 are assumed to be average referenced.

 The structure for NIRS channels contains
    sens.label         = Mx1 cell-array with channel labels
    sens.chanpos       = Mx3 matrix with position of the channels (usually halfway the transmitter and receiver)
    sens.optopos       = Nx3 matrix with the position of individual optodes
    sens.optotype      = Nx1 cell-array with information about the type of optode (receiver or transmitter)
    sens.optolabel     = Nx1 cell-array with optode labels
    sens.wavelength    = 1xK vector of all wavelengths that were used
    sens.tra           = MxN matrix that specifies for each of the M channels which of the N optodes transmits at which wavelength (positive integer from 1 to K), or receives (negative ingeger from 1 to K)

 The following fields apply to MEG, EEG, sEEG and ECoG
    sens.chantype = Mx1 cell-array with the type of the channel, see FT_CHANTYPE
    sens.chanunit = Mx1 cell-array with the units of the channel signal, e.g. 'V', 'fT' or 'T/cm', see FT_CHANUNIT

 The following fields are optional
    sens.type = string with the type of acquisition system, see FT_SENSTYPE
    sens.fid  = structure with fiducial information

 Historical fields:
    pnt, pos, ori, pnt1, pnt2, fiberpos, fibertype, fiberlabel, transceiver, transmits, laserstrength

 Revision history:
 (2020/latest) Updated the specification of the NIRS sensor definition.
   Dropped the laserstrength and renamed transmits into tra for consistency.

 (2019/latest) Updated the specification of the NIRS sensor definition.
   Use "opto" instead of "fibers", see http://bit.ly/33WaqWU for details.

 (2016) The chantype and chanunit have become required fields.
  Original channel details are specified with the suffix "old" rather than "org".
  All numeric values are represented in double precision.
  It is possible to convert the amplitude and distance units (e.g. from T to fT and
  from m to mm) and it is possible to express planar and axial gradiometer channels
  either in units of amplitude or in units of amplitude/distance (i.e. proper
  gradient).

 (2011v2) The chantype and chanunit have been added for MEG.

 (2011v1) To facilitate determining the position of channels (e.g. for plotting)
  in case of balanced MEG or bipolar EEG, an explicit distinction has been made
  between chanpos+chanori and coilpos+coilori (for MEG) and chanpos and elecpos
  (for EEG). The pnt and ori fields are removed

 (2010) Added support for bipolar or otherwise more complex linear combinations
  of EEG electrodes using sens.tra, similar to MEG.

 (2009) Noice reduction has been added for MEG systems in the balance field.

 (2006) The optional fields sens.type and sens.unit were added.

 (2003) The initial version was defined, which looked like this for EEG
    sens.pnt     = Mx3 matrix with electrode positions
    sens.label   = Mx1 cell-array with channel labels
 and like this for MEG
    sens.pnt     = Nx3 matrix with coil positions
    sens.ori     = Nx3 matrix with coil orientations
    sens.tra     = MxN matrix to combine coils into channels
    sens.label   = Mx1 cell-array with channel labels
