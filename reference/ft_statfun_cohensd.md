 FT_STATFUN_COHENSD computes the effect size according to Cohen's d. This function
 supports both unpaired and paired designs.

 The table below contains descriptors for magnitudes of Cohen's d.
   Very small  0.01
   Small       0.20
   Medium      0.50
   Large       0.80
   Very large  1.20
   Huge        2.00

 Use this function by calling one of the high-level statistics functions as
   [stat] = ft_timelockstatistics(cfg, timelock1, timelock2, ...)
   [stat] = ft_freqstatistics(cfg, freq1, freq2, ...)
   [stat] = ft_sourcestatistics(cfg, source1, source2, ...)
 with the following configuration option:
   cfg.statistic = 'ft_statfun_cohensd'

 The experimental design is specified as:
   cfg.ivar  = independent variable, row number of the design that contains the labels of the conditions to be compared (default=1)
   cfg.uvar  = optional, row number of design that contains the labels of the units-of-observation, i.e. subjects or trials (default=2)

 The labels for the independent variable should be specified as the number 1 and 2.
 The labels for the unit of observation should be integers ranging from 1 to the
 total number of observations (subjects or trials).

 The cfg.uvar option is only needed for paired data, you should leave it empty
 for non-paired data.
