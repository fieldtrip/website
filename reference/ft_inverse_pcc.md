```plaintext
 FT_INVERSE_PCC implements a linearly-constrained miminum variance beamformer that
 allows for post-hoc computation of canonical or partial coherence or correlation.
 Moreover, if cortico-cortical interactions are computed, the spatial filters are
 computed with a paired dipole as sourcemodel, thus suppressing the distortive
 effect of correlated activity from the seed region.

 Use as
   [estimate] = ft_inverse_pcc(sourcemodel, sens, headmodel, dat, cov, ...)
 where
   sourcemodel is the input source model, see FT_PREPARE_SOURCEMODEL
   sens        is the gradiometer or electrode definition, see FT_DATATYPE_SENS
   headmodel   is the volume conductor definition, see FT_PREPARE_HEADMODEL
   dat         is the data matrix with the ERP or ERF
   cov         is the data covariance or cross-spectral density matrix
 and
   estimate    contains the estimated source parameters

 Additional input arguments should be specified as key-value pairs and can include
   'refchan'
   'refdip'
   'supchan'
   'supdip'
   'feedback'
   'keepcsd'
   'keepfilter'
   'keepleadfield'
   'keepmom'
   'lambda'
   'projectnoise'
   'realfilter'
   'fixedori'

 These options influence the forward computation of the leadfield
   'reducerank'      = 'no' or number  (default = 3 for EEG, 2 for MEG)
   'backproject'     = 'yes' or 'no', in the case of a rank reduction this parameter determines whether the result will be backprojected onto the original subspace (default = 'yes')
   'normalize'       = 'no', 'yes' or 'column' (default = 'no')
   'normalizeparam'  = parameter for depth normalization (default = 0.5)
   'weight'          = number or Nx1 vector, weight for each dipole position to compensate for the size of the corresponding patch (default = 1)
