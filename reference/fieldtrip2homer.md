 FIELDTRIP2HOMER converts a continuous raw data structure from FieldTrip format to
 Homer format.

 Use as
   nirs = fieldtrip2homer(data, ...)
 where the input data structure is formatted according to the output of
 FT_PREPROCESSING and the output nirs structure is according to Homer.

 Additional options should be specified in key-value pairs and can be
   'event'        = event structure that corresponds to the data, see FT_READ_EVENT

 See https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/homer2:Homer_Input_Files#NIRS_data_file_format
 for a description of the Homer data structure.
