```plaintext
 FT_TIMELOCKSIMULATION computes simulated data that consists of multiple trials in
 with each trial contains an event-related potential or field. Following
 construction of the time-locked signal in each trial by this function, the signals
 can be passed into FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS to obtain the average and the variance.

 Use as
   [data] = ft_timelockstatistics(cfg)
 which will return a raw data structure that resembles the output of
 FT_PREPROCESSING.

 The number of trials and the time axes of the trials can be specified by
   cfg.fsample    = simulated sample frequency (default = 1000)
   cfg.trllen     = length of simulated trials in seconds (default = 1)
   cfg.numtrl     = number of simulated trials (default = 10)
   cfg.baseline   = number (default = 0.3)
 or by
   cfg.time       = cell-array with one time axis per trial, which are for example obtained from an existing dataset

 The signal is constructed from three underlying functions. The shape is
 controlled with
   cfg.s1.numcycli = number (default = 1)
   cfg.s1.ampl     = number (default = 1.0)
   cfg.s2.numcycli = number (default = 2)
   cfg.s2.ampl     = number (default = 0.7)
   cfg.s3.numcycli = number (default = 4)
   cfg.s3.ampl     = number (default = 0.2)
   cfg.noise.ampl  = number (default = 0.1)
 Specifying numcycli=1 results in a monophasic signal, numcycli=2 is a biphasic,
 etc. The three signals are scaled to the indicated amplitude, summed up and a
 certain amount of noise is added.

 Other configuration options include
   cfg.numchan     = number (default = 5)
