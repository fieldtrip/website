 FT_STATISTICS_MVPA performs multivariate pattern classification or regression using
 the MVPA-Light toolbox. The function supports cross-validation, searchlight
 analysis, generalization, nested preprocessing, a variety of classification and
 regression metrics, as well as statistical testing of these metrics. This function
 should not be called directly, instead you should call the function that is
 associated with the type of data on which you want to perform the test.

 Use as
   stat = ft_timelockstatistics(cfg, data1, data2, data3, ...)
   stat = ft_freqstatistics    (cfg, data1, data2, data3, ...)
   stat = ft_sourcestatistics  (cfg, data1, data2, data3, ...)

 where the data is obtained from FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS, FT_FREQANALYSIS or
 FT_SOURCEANALYSIS respectively, or from FT_TIMELOCKGRANDAVERAGE,
 FT_FREQGRANDAVERAGE or FT_SOURCEGRANDAVERAGE respectively
 and with cfg.method = 'mvpa'

 The configuration options that can be specified are:
   cfg.features        = specifies the name or index of the dimension(s)
                         that serve(s) as features for the classifier or
                         regression model. Dimensions that are not
                         samples or features act as search
                         dimensions. For instance, assume the data is a
                         3D array of size [samples x channels x time].
                         If mvpa.features = 2, the channels serve as
                         features. A classification is then performed for
                         each time point (we call time a searchlight
                         dimension). Conversely, if mvpa.features = 3, the
                         time points serve as features. A classification
                         is performed for each channel (channel is a
                         searchlight dimension).
                         If mvpa.features = [], then all non-sample
                         dimensions serve as searchlight dimensions.
                         If the dimensions have names (ie cfg.dimord
                         exists), then instead of numbers the feature can
                         be specified as a string (e.g. 'chan').
                         (default 2)
   cfg.generalize      = specifies the name or index of the dimensions
                         that serves for generalization (if any). For
                         instance, if the data is [samples x channels x
                         time], and mvpa.generalize = 3, a time x time
                         generalization is performed. If mvpa.generalize =
                         2, a electrode x electrode generalization is
                         performed. mvpa.generalize must refer to a
                         searchlight dimension, therefore its value must
                         be different from the value of mvpa.features.
                         (default [])

 The configuration contains a substruct cfg.mvpa that contains detailed
 options for the MVPA. Possible fields
   cfg.mvpa.classifier  = string specifying the classifier
                         Available classifiers:
                         'ensemble'     Ensemble of classifiers. Any of the other
                                        classifiers can be used as a learner.
                         'kernel_fda'   Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis
                         'lda'          Regularized linear discriminant analysis
                                        (LDA) (for two classes)
                         'logreg'       Logistic regression
                         'multiclass_lda' LDA for more than two classes
                         'naive_bayes'  Naive Bayes
                         'svm'          Support Vector Machine (SVM)
                         More details on the classifiers: https://github.com/treder/MVPA-Light#classifiers-for-two-classes-
                         Additionally, you can choose 'libsvm' or
                         'liblinear' as a model. They provide interfaces
                         for logistic regression, SVM, and Support Vector
                         Regression. Note that they can act as either
                         classifiers or regression models. An installation
                         of LIBSVM or LIBLINEAR is required.
   cfg.mvpa.model       = string specifying the regression model. If a
                         regression model has been specified,
                         cfg.mvpa.classifier should be empty (and vice
                         versa). If neither a classifier nor regression
                         model is specified, a LDA classifier is used by
                         default.

                         Available regression models:
                         'ridge         Ridge regression
                         'kernel_ridge' Kernel Ridge regression
                         More details on the regression models: https://github.com/treder/MVPA-Light#regression-models-
   cfg.mvpa.metric      = string, classification or regression metric, or
                         cell array with multiple metrics.
                         Classification metrics: accuracy auc confusion
                             dval f1 kappa precision recall tval
                         Regression metrics: mae mse r_squared

   cfg.mvpa.hyperparameter = struct, structure with hyperparameters for the
                         classifier or regression model (see HYPERPARAMETERS below)
   cfg.mvpa.feedback       = 'yes' or 'no', whether or not to print feedback on the console (default 'yes')

 To obtain a realistic estimate of classification performance, cross-validation
 is used. It is controlled by the following parameters:
   cfg.mvpa.cv          = string, cross-validation type, either 'kfold', 'leaveout'
                         'holdout', or 'predefined'. If 'none', no cross-validation is
                         used and the model is tested on the training
                         set. (default 'kfold')
   cfg.mvpa.k           = number of folds in k-fold cross-validation (default 5)
   cfg.mvpa.repeat      = number of times the cross-validation is repeated
                         with new randomly assigned folds (default 5)
   cfg.mvpa.p           = if cfg.cv is 'holdout', p is the fraction of test
                         samples (default 0.1)
   cfg.mvpa.stratify    = if 1, the class proportions are approximately
                         preserved in each test fold (default 1)
   cfg.mvpa.fold        = if cv='predefined', fold is a vector of length
                         #samples that specifies the fold each sample belongs to

 More information about each classifier is found in the documentation of
 MVPA-Light (github.com/treder/MVPA-Light/).

 HYPERPARAMETERS:
 Each classifier comes with its own set of hyperparameters, such as
 regularization parameters and the kernel. Hyperparameters can be set
 using the cfg.mvpa.hyperparameter substruct. For instance, in LDA,
 cfg.mvpa.hyperparameter = 'auto' sets the lambda regularization parameter.

 The specification of the hyperparameters is found in the training function
 for each model at github.com/treder/MVPA-Light/tree/master/model
 If a hyperparameter is not specified, default values are used.

 SEARCHLIGHT ANALYSIS:
 Data dimensions that are not samples or features serve as 'search
 dimensions'. For instance, if the data is [samples x chan x time]
 and mvpa.features = 'time', then the channel dimension serves as search
 dimension: a separate analysis is carried out for each channel. Instead
 of considering each channel individually, a searchlight can be defined
 such that each channel is used together with its neighbours. Neighbours
 can be specified using the cfg.neighbours field:

   cfg.neighbours   = neighbourhood structure, see FT_PREPARE_NEIGHBOURS
   cfg.timwin       = integer, if MVPA is performed for each time point,
                      timwin specfies the total size of the time window
                      that is considered as features.
                      Example: for cfg.timwin = 3 a given time point is considered
                      together with the immediately preceding and following
                      time points. Increasing timwin typially
                      leads to smoother results along the time axis.
   cfg.freqwin      = integer, acts like cfg.timwin but across frequencies

 This returns:
   stat.metric = this contains the requested metric
