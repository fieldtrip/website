 FT_CROSSFREQUENCYANALYSIS performs cross-frequency analysis

 Use as
   crossfreq = ft_crossfrequencyanalysis(cfg, freq)
   crossfreq = ft_crossfrequencyanalysis(cfg, freqlo, freqhi)

 The input data should be organised in a structure as obtained from the
 FT_FREQANALYSIS function. The configuration should be according to

   cfg.freqlow    = scalar or vector, selection of frequencies for the low frequency data
   cfg.freqhigh   = scalar or vector, selection of frequencies for the high frequency data

 Channel selection can be specified according to whether one wants to perform within- or
 cross-channel analysis.

 For within-channel analysis (default), you should specifies only a single channel selection:
   cfg.channel    = cell-array with selection of channels, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION
 In this case, the output "dimord" will be "chan_freqlow_freqhigh"

 For cross-channel analysis, you should specifies two channel selections:
   cfg.chanlow    = cell-array with selection of channels for the phase providing channels from the
                    freqlow data argument, with wildcards allowed, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION
   cfg.chanhigh   = cell-array with selection of channels for the amplitude providing channels from the
                    freqhigh data argument, with wildcards allowed, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION
 In this case, the output "dimord" will be "chancmb_freqlow_freqhigh" and "label"
 field will be replaced with "labelcmb" (corresponding to the dimension "chancmb")
 describing the pairs of channel combinations as
   {'chanlow01' 'chanhigh01'
    'chanlow01' 'chanhigh02'
    ... 
    'chanlow02' 'chanhigh01'
    'chanlow02' 'chanhigh02'
    ...
    }
 N.B.: The order of channels corresponds to their order in the original "label" field

 Various metrics for cross-frequency coupling have been introduced in a number of
 scientific publications, but these do not use a consistent method naming scheme,
 nor implement it in exactly the same way. The particular implementation in this
 code tries to follow the most common format, generalizing where possible. If you
 want details about the algorithms, please look into the code.
   cfg.method     = string, can be
                     'coh' - coherence
                     'plv' - phase locking value
                     'mvl' - mean vector length
                     'mi'  - modulation index
                     'pac' - phase amplitude coupling

 The modulation index and phase amplitude coupling implement
