 FT_BADSEGMENT tries to identify bad segments or trials in a MEG or EEG dataset.
 Different methods are implemented to identify bad channels, these are largely
 shared with those implemented in FT_REJECTVISUAL with the summary method.

 VAR, STD, MIN, MAX, MAXABS, RANGE, KURTOSIS, ZVALUE - compute the specified metric
 for each channel in each trial and check whether it exceeds the threshold.

 NEIGHBEXPVAR - identifies channels that cannot be explained very well by a linear
 combination of their neighbours. A general linear model is used to compute the
 explained variance. A value close to 1 means that a channel is similar to its
 neighbours, a value close to 0 indicates a "bad" channel.

 NEIGHBCORR - identifies channels that have low correlation with each of their
 neighbours. The rationale is that "bad" channel have inherent noise that is
 uncorrelated with other sensors.

 NEIGHBSTDRATIO - identifies channels that have a standard deviation which is very
 different from that of each of their neighbours. This computes the difference in
 the standard deviation of each channel to each of its neighbours, relative to that
 of the neighbours.

 Use as
   [cfg, artifact] = ft_badchannel(cfg, data)
 where the input data corresponds to the output from FT_PREPROCESSING.

 The configuration should contain
   cfg.metric        = string, describes the metric that should be computed in summary mode for each channel in each trial, can be
                       'var'       variance within each channel (default)
                       'min'       minimum value in each channel
                       'max'       maximum value in each channel
                       'maxabs'    maximum absolute value in each channel
                       'range'     range from min to max in each channel
                       'kurtosis'  kurtosis, i.e. measure of peakedness of the amplitude distribution
                       'zvalue'    mean and std computed over all time and trials, per channel
   cfg.threshold     = scalar, the optimal value depends on the methods and on the data characteristics
   cfg.neighbours    = neighbourhood structure, see FT_PREPARE_NEIGHBOURS for details
   cfg.nbdetect      = 'any', 'most', 'all', 'median', see below (default = 'median')
   cfg.feedback      = 'yes' or 'no', whether to show an image of the neighbour values (default = 'no')

 The following options allow you to make a pre-selection
   cfg.channel     = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels (default = 'all'), see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
   cfg.trials      = 'all' or a selection given as a 1xN vector (default = 'all')

 The 'neighcorrel' and 'neighstdratio' methods implement the bad channel detection
 (more or less) according to the paper "Adding dynamics to the Human Connectome
 Project with MEG", Larson-Prior et al. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.056.

 Most methods compute a scalar value for each channel that can simply be
 thresholded. The NEIGHBCORR and NEIGHBSTDRATIO compute a vector with a value for
 each of the neighbour of a channel. The cfg.nbdetect option allows you to specify
 whether you want to flag the channel as bad in case 'all' of its neighbours exceed
 the threshold, if 'most' exceed the threshold, or if 'any' of them exceeds the
 threshold. Note that when you specify 'any', then all channels neighbouring a bad
 channel will also be marked as bad, since they all have at least one bad neighbour.
 You can also specify 'median', in which case the threshold is applied to the median
 value over neighbours.
