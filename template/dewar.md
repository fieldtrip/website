title: Template MEG dewar shapes
tags: [template, dewar]

To help position the subject in the MEG dewar (i.e. the helmet), you can use **[ft_realtime_headlocalizer](/reference/realtime/online_meg/ft_realtime_headlocalizer)** in combination with the FieldTrip [realtime interface](/development/realtime). Template dewar outlines are available for the CTF and the Neuromag/Elekta/MEGIN system and will be loaded automatically. The head localizer allows you to visualize the following geometries:

- head localizer coils
- realistic head shape, recorded with Polhemus or Structure Sensor
- schematic outline of the head as a sphere
- MEG sensor positions
- dewar outline
