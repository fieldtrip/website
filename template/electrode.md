# Template 3-D electrode sets

Electrodes are represented as points in 3-D Cartesian space, i.e. with an X, Y and Z position for each electrode. Furthermore, each electrode has a label. There is a frequently asked question about [how the electrode structure is described](/faq/how_are_electrodes_magnetometers_or_gradiometers_described).

You can use the following snippet of code to get a quick overview of the template electrode sets.

    dirlist  = dir('template/electrode/*.*');
    filename = {dirlist(~[dirlist.isdir]).name}';

    for i=1:length(filename)
      elec = ft_read_sens(filename{i});

      figure
      ft_plot_sens(elec, 'label', 'yes');
      grid on
      rotate3d
      view(135, 20);
      title(filename{i}, 'Interpreter', 'none');

      [p, f, x] = fileparts(filename{i});
      print([lower(f) '.png'], '-dpng');
    end

## The 10-20, 10-10 and 10-5 system for electrode placement

The following template electrode sets describe the 10-20 EEG electrodes and were constructed by Robert Oostenveld and described in [The five percent electrode system for high-resolution EEG and ERP measurements](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1388-2457(00)00527-7). More details on the electrode positioning and the different naming schemes can be found in the five percent paper and on Robert's [personal blog](http://robertoostenveld.nl/?p=5).

The electrodes are stored in an ASA `.elc` file which can be read with **[ft_read_sens](/reference/fileio/ft_read_sens)**. The electrode positions are represented in mm in the MNI coordinate system and correspond to the template BEM volume conduction model detailed in [this publication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12842715) and that is available in the `fieldtrip/template/headmodel` directory as `standard_bem.mat`. See also [this page](/template/headmodel/#standard_bemmat).

## The EGI geodesic sensor net

The following template electrode sets are for the [EGI](http://www.egi.com) geodesic sensor net and were downloaded from the EGI [FTP server](ftp://www.egi.com/).

- GSN-HydroCel-32.sfp
- GSN-HydroCel-64.sfp
- GSN-HydroCel-65.sfp
- GSN-HydroCel-128.sfp
- GSN-HydroCel-129.sfp
- GSN-HydroCel-256.sfp
- GSN-HydroCel-257.sfp

Note that the _even_ versions (32, 64, 128, 256) do not include the position of the vertex reference electrode (aka Cz), whereas the _odd_ versions (65, 129, 257) do include the position of the vertex reference electrode.

## Easycap electrode arrangements

The following template electrode sets are for the [Easycap](http://www.easycap.de/easycap/e/products/products.htm) electrode arrangements and were downloaded from the Easycap [download page](http://www.easycap.de/easycap/e/downloads/electrode_sites_coordinates.htm).

- easycap-M1.sfp with full 10% system
- easycap-M10.sfp with equidistant 61-channel arrangement
