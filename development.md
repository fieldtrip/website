# Development

For direct access to the code, please refer to the [Git and GitHub](/development/git) documentation.

For keeping track of new ideas, feature requests and bugs, we use an [issue tracking system](/development/issues).

The source code in the FieldTrip toolbox is split over multiple directories reflecting its [modular organization](/development/architecture/#modular-organization). This facilitates a separation between high-level functions that do data bookkeeping, and low-level functions that focus on the algorithms.

We use a combination of tools (GitHub, Mastodon, website, mailman) that are loosely linked to each other; for example, every news item on the website is automatically tweeted. An overview is presented on the [integration](/development/integration) page.
