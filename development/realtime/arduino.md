# Streaming realtime EEG data to and from Arduino

The following is a scratch pad for a demo that I (=Robert) have prepared for the [BrainGain public showcase event](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=BrainGain_NL). It consists of three Arduino devices, a Raspberry Pi and and a number of laptops. The flow of the data is as follows:

1.  arduino1: read data from a gravity sensor, write to bluetooth just like ModEEG
2.  laptop computer runs the FieldTrip buffer, the modeeg2ft application, and the [viewer](/development/realtime/viewer) application for the visualization of the 3 sensor channels
3.  arduino2: connects to the network, read data from FieldTrip buffer, write to RFM12b
4.  arduino3: read data from RFM12b, blink LEDs

Other laptop computers and a Raspberry Pi were connected simultaneously to show (using the [viewer](/development/realtime/viewer) realtime visualization) that the FieldTrip realtime EEG interface runs on various operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) and on various hardware architectures (Intel, PPC, ARM).

## Arduino 1: simulate EEG recording

The purpose of this device is to simulate an online data stream using a gravity sensor. By shaking the box, the (x, y, z) signals will fluctuate. This is sent over bluetooth to a computer, which can visualize and/or process the continuously sampled signal as if it were normal EEG.

It is based on a [Sparkfun Pro Micro 3V3](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10999). The connection to the "EEG acquisition" computer is through a [BlueSMiRF](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10269) bluetooth modem. The realtime signal is provided by a [triple axis accelerometer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9652) module.

The Bluetooth module was configured with the following settings. See http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/Bluetooth/rn-bluetooth-um.pdf

**_Settings_**
BTA=00066649542F
BTName=RN42-542F
Baudrt=57.6
Parity=None
Mode =Slav
Authen=0
Encryp=0
PinCod=1234
Bonded=0
Rem=000666495493

The modeeg synchronization code is 0xA5 0x5A, or 165 90 in decimal.

## Arduino 2: interface with FieldTrip buffer

The purpose of this device is to demonstrate that an arduino with ethershield is capable of connecting to a FieldTrip buffer over TCP/IP, read the data and do something with it. This device is connected with Ethernet, reads some data and passes it on using a wireless RFM12b (433/886 MHz) connection.

It is based on a ~~Sparkfun Pro Micro~~ [Arduino Pro Mini 3V3](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardProMini). Ethernet is provided by a [WIZnet W5100](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9473) network module. Wireless connectivity is provided by a [RFM12B](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9582) module.

This [comment](https://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=32037#p152780) gives the SPI interface pins for the Sparkfun Pro Micr

- SPI: 10 (SS), 16 (MOSI), 14 (MISO), 15 (SCK)

- External Interrupts: ?

The SPI interface for the Arduino Pro Mini is on

- SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK)

## Arduino 3: linear LED array

The purpose of this device is to demonstrate that something can be controlled. It reads the control signal using a wireless RFM12b (433/886 MHz) connection and visualizes it with a 10-segment LED array. Instead of driving the LED array, it could also act as a switch or drive a servo motor.

It is based on a ~~[3V3 Arduino Pro Mini](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardProMini)~~ [5V Arduino Mini](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMini).

- SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK)
- External Interrupts: 2 and 3 (?)

Wireless connectivity is provided by a [RFM12B](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9582) module and uses this [library](http://jeelabs.net/pub/docs/jeelib/RF12_8cpp.html).
