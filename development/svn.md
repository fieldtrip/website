title: Accessing the FieldTrip source code through SVN
tags: [development, cvs, svn, git]
---

The FieldTrip code used to be managed using the [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) version control system, also known as SVN. In February 2016 we switched over to [Git](https://git-scm.com) and you can now access the code and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip).

Please see our [GitHub tutorial](/development/git) for details.
