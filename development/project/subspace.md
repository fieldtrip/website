title: Implement support for a separation of data into a signal and noise subspace
---

{% include /shared/development/warning.md %}

## Objectives

1.  Allow the suppression of a known noise-subspace in inverse modelling
2.  Consolidate the construction and representation of signal and noise subspace (sofar used in beamforming and MUSIC)
3.  Implement support for the Neuromag subspace method of dealing with environmental noise
