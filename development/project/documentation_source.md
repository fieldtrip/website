# Developing the documentation of the source-reconstruction methods

## Introduction

This page contains questions that users could ask when they analyze their data with FieldTrip. If it is possible the answers are also provided. If any documentation already exist on the FieldTrip wiki website gives an answer, the answer should point to those pages. In some cases, may we just want to point to relevant literature.

## Questions and Answers

## What kind of source-reconstruction methods are implemented in FieldTrip?

The [Inverse source parameter estimates from EEG/MEG data](/development/module/inverse) page describes under the second point which are the supported methods.

1.  dipole fitting
    - simultaneous optimisation of position, orientation and strength
    - symmetry constrains and/or fixed position, with free orientation and strength
2.  dipole scanning
    - dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS)
    - linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV)
    - partial canonical coherence (PCC)
    - multiple signal classification (MUSIC)
    - scanning for residual variance
3.  distributed source modeling
    - minimum norm estimation with and without noise regularisation (MNE)

The reference of the **[ft_sourceanalysis](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/blob/release/ft_sourceanalysis.m)** function refers to the following method

    cfg.method = 'lcmv'    linear constrained minimum variance beamformer
                 'sam'     synthetic aperture magnetometry
                 'dics'    dynamic imaging of coherent sources
                 'pcc'     partial cannonical correlation/coherence
                 'mne'     minimum norm estimation
                 'loreta'  minimum norm estimation with smoothness constraint
                 'rv'      scan residual variance with single dipole
                 'music'   multiple signal classification
                 'mvl'     multivariate Laplace source localization

## What is the difference between the methods?

Here are the [References to implemented methods](/references_to_implemented_methods).

## What kind of source-reconstruction method should I use?

- _Does it depend on the data?_ (EEG vs. MEG, oscillations vs event-related, realistic vs. non-realistic headmodel)

Event-related Field/Potential + time-course: MNE
Oscillatory activity + at certain point in time: beamforming (dics)
beamforming: lcmv - ?
(see Hesse, Jensen (2010) and Background of the MNE tutorial)

- _Does it depend on a priori hypothesis of the source involved?_ (cortical sheets vs. 3D grid)
- _Does it depend on what kind of information I am interested in?_ (e.g., changes in time or not)

## What kind of data I need for source-reconstruction?

functional data, anatomical data, channel/electrode positions

## Why should I use source-reconstruction?

point to introductionary literature

## How should I do source-reconstruction?

depends on the specific method; available documentation in FT at the momen

### dipolefitting

- simultaneous optimisation of position, orientation and strength
- symmetry constrains and/or fixed position, with free orientation and strength

**tutorial sites:**

none.

** example scripts:**

[Compute forward simulated data and apply a dipole fit](/example/compute_forward_simulated_data_and_apply_a_dipole_fit)

[Fit a dipole to the tactile ERF after mechanical stimulation](/example/dipolefit_somatosensory_erf)

_Why is this fixme?_

[Source-reconstruction using two dipoles](/development/project/symmetric_dipoles)

_This is under construction, but it is not really clear how this exactly relates to dipole fitting._

### dipole scanning

- dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS)
- linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV)
- partial canonical coherence (PCC)
- multiple signal classification (MUSIC)
- scanning for residual variance

### distributed source modeling

- minimum norm estimation with and without noise regularisation (MNE)
