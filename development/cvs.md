# Accessing the FieldTrip source code through CVS

Initial FieldTrip code development from 2004 onwards was using [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), the Concurrent Versions System. Around 2009 we switched over to SVN. In February 2016 we switched over to [Git](https://git-scm.com) and you can now access the code and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip).

Please see our [GitHub tutorial](/development/git) for details.
