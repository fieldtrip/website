- With the diverse [triangulation techniques](/#Triangulation methods) obtain the points of the triangulated surface around the inner skull volume\\
- Calculate a plane tangent to the inner skull points\\
- Determine one point on the non-conductive side of the electrodes\\
- **[only for the Slab method]** Determine the thickness of the slab (e.g. cortical thickness)\\
- Electrodes are not allowed to be in the vacuum side, therefore faulty electrodes are automatically reprojected on the plane\\
