The core FieldTrip development team is located at the Donders Institute in Nijmegen, NL. We also have active contributors elsewhere, e.g., people that worked in Nijmegen in the past, or people that have no ties to the Donders.

We organize occasional meetings at the Donders to discuss topics related to the development. Although we don't want to put too much effort in the minutes and therefore might not be consistent with them, below you can find a list of meetings for which an agenda or notes were made.
