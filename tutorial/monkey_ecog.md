# Analysis of monkey ECoG recordings

## Introduction

In the following tutorial we will analyze a whole hemisphere EcoG grid implanted in a macaque monkey. This data set has been recorded in the Laboratory for Adaptive Intelligence, BSI, RIKEN, Japan and has been shared as part of the [NeuroTycho](http://neurotycho.org/) project. The NeuroTycho homepage also provides some information about why and how the data is shared so that we will not expand on this here. Instead this tutorial provides some overview of how to get started with ECoG data by using this particular data set as an example.

## Background

This particular experiment deals with a visual grating task. This particular task is known to reliably elicit a sustained signal in the gamma frequency range ~60-80 Hz in both humans and nonhuman primates. More elaborate discussion on the sustained gamma band signal can be found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308003747). The animal is seated with fixated head and restrained arm motion in front of a black screen. A grating pattern in eight different orientation has been presented for 2 seconds following a 2 seconds baseline period (black screen) while the brain activity was monitored with 128 channel ECoG grid covering the entire right hemisphere (Figure1). Some more information can be found [here](http://neurotycho.org/visual-grating-task), where you can also download the data.

## Procedure

The tutorial will follow the steps:

- prepare a 2D electrode layout for visualization that will be used throughout the tutorial with **[ft_prepare_layout](/reference/ft_prepare_layout)** and plot it with **[ft_layoutplot](/reference/ft_layoutplot)**
- load data into MATLAB and assemble it into a format FieldTrip can deal with
- define a trial structure and subsequently use **[ft_redefinetrial](/reference/ft_redefinetrial)** in order to separate the eight conditions/orientations.
- append the data into a common dataset **[ft_appenddata](/reference/ft_appenddata)** apply an independent component analysis using **[ft_componentanalysis](/reference/ft_componentanalysis)** after which we will plot and explore some components using **[ft_databrowser](/reference/ft_databrowser)**
- Compute time-frequency representations of power and plot using **[ft_freqanalysis](/reference/ft_freqanalysis)** and **[ft_multiplotTFR](/reference/ft_multiplotTFR)** respectively.
- Compute coherence between reference electrode and the remaining electrodes using **[ft_connectivityanalysis](/reference/ft_connectivityanalysis)**.
- Perform networkanalysis using **[ft_networkanalysis](/reference/ft_networkanalysis)**

### Preprocessing

First we will generate the layout along the guidelines explained in the layout tutorial [here](/tutorial/layout). Once you have downloaded and uncompressed the data you can load and restructure it in the following way. Alternatively you can download the reformatted data [here](https://download.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/monkey_ecog).

    load Event.mat
    load lay
    vec=1:128;
    for i=1:length(vec)
     filename=strcat('ECoG_ch', num2str(vec(i)));
     data.label{i} = num2str(vec(i));
     load(filename)
     filename2 = strcat('ECoGData_ch', num2str(vec(i)));
     data.trial(i,:) = eval(filename2);
     data.time = {EventTime};
     data.fsample = 1000;
    end

    data.trial = {data.trial};
    data.label = lay.label(1:128);
    data.trial = double(data.trial{1})
    data.trial = {data.trial};
    data.label{129} = 'event';
    clear ECoG*

Using the information provided in the "readme.txt" file, we can build a trial structure that can be used during the call to **[ft_redefinetrial](/reference/ft_redefinetrial)**

    trigger = EventData;
    sample  = EventIndex;

    % determine the number of samples before and after the trigger
    pretrig  = -data.fsample*2;
    posttrig =  data.fsample*2;

    trl = [];
    for j = 2:(length(trigger)-2)
      trg1 = trigger(j);
      trg2 = trigger(j+1);
      trg3 = trigger(j+1);
      trg4 = trigger(j-1);

      %%% provided txt file reads that
      %%% orientation one spans values from 650 to 750
      %%% baseline spans values from 300 400

      if trg1 > 400 && trg2 `< 750 && trg3 >`= 650 && trg4 <= 400
        trlbegin = sample(j) + pretrig;
        trlend   = sample(j) + posttrig;
        offset   = pretrig;
        newtrl   = [trlbegin trlend offset];
        trl      = [trl; newtrl];
      end
    end

The structure **trl** is now a 20 rows by 3 columns matrix containing the begin, end and offset(i.e. baseline) samples for each trial of type _45Â° orientation_. Subsequently we call **[ft_redefinetrial](/reference/ft_redefinetrial)** where we provide the trial structure computed in the previous step **cfg.trl = trl;**.

    cfg     = [];
    cfg.trl = trl;
    data_1 = ft_redefinetrial(cfg,data);

Now we illustrate the time course of the channel defining the event in order to check whether trial onset was appropriately assigned.

    cfg           = [];
    cfg.trl       = data_1.trial;
    cfg.channel   = 'event';
    cfg.ylim      = [0 3000];
    cfg.blocksize = 4;
    ft_databrowser(cfg, data_1);

{% include image src="/assets/img/tutorial/monkey_ecog/figure2.png" width="400" %}

_Figure 2: Event onset at time stamp 0 and duration 2 seconds._

Next, we will use independent component analysis to identify the presence of artifacts but also the presence of oscillatory activity. First, the data is resampled down to 140 Hz in order to speed up the calculation of the independent components. We reduce the iteration steps to 50 and finally project the original high sampling data thru the identified components again.

    %% resample the data
    cfg            = [];
    cfg.resamplefs = 140;
    cfg.detrend    = 'no';
    datads = ft_resampledata(cfg, data);

    % decompose the data
    cfg                 = [];
    cfg.method          = 'runica';
    cfg.runica.maxsteps = 50;
    comp = ft_componentanalysis(cfg, datads);

    % project the original data thru the components again
    cfg           = [];
    cfg.unmixing  = comp.unmixing;
    cfg.topolabel = comp.topolabel;
    comp = ft_componentanalysis(cfg, data);

We will use **[ft_databrowser](/reference/ft_databrowser)** again in order to plot the topography of the components and corresponding time courses. In the present case only particular components bearing artifacts (component 22) and clear oscillatory signatures (11,43,44) are plotted.

{% include image src="/assets/img/tutorial/monkey_ecog/figure3.png" width="400" %}

_Figure 3: Independent components illustrating some clear visual (1 and 11) and sensorimotor (43,44) topography and oscillatory time course._

The build-in functionality of **[ft_databrowser](/reference/ft_databrowser)** allows for interactively mark a time window and perform a spectral analysis via left mouse click. This launches an additional figure that allows for adding and removing of component's power spectra and (log/linear) scale adjustments. Doing so we can confirm the presence of 10.89 Hz alpha peak (compontent 11) over occipito-posterior electrodes (component 11 topography in Figure 3).

### Time-frequency analysis

After rejecting bad components with **[ft_rejectcomponent](/reference/ft_rejectcomponent)** a time-frequency analysis can be performed. Detailed information regarding this analysis step is extensively covered [here](/tutorial/timefrequencyanalysis). Furthermore, we will use different settings for the estimates of low (`<40Hz) and high (>`40Hz) frequencies. The rational behind this strategy is also covered in the time-frequency tutorial and extensively explained by Robert in the video lecture [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EIBh5lHNSc). The time-frequency representation of power is calculated with **[ft_freqanalysis](/reference/ft_freqanalysis)**. Subsequently the power estimates are baseline corrected with **[ft_freqbaseline](/reference/ft_freqbaseline)** and plotted with **[ft_multiplotTFR](/reference/ft_multiplotTFR)**.

    % perform time-frequency analysis
    cfg              = [];
    cfg.output       = 'pow';
    cfg.method       = 'mtmconvol';
    cfg.taper        = 'hanning';
    cfg.foi          = 1:1:40;
    cfg.t_ftimwin    = ones(length(cfg.foi),1).*0.5;
    cfg.toi          = -2:0.05:2;
    cfg.keeptrials   ='yes';
    tfr = ft_freqanalysis(cfg,data);

    % baseline correction
    cfg               = [];
    cfg.baseline      = [-1 0];
    cfg.baselinetype  = 'db';
    tfrbl = ft_freqbaseline(cfg, tfr);

    % plot the result
    cfg           = [];
    cfg.channel   = {'all'};
    cfg.xlim      = [-.2 2];
    cfg.ylim      = [1 40];
    cfg.fontsize  = 12;
    cfg.layout    = lay;
    % cfg.zlim    = [-.5 .5];
    figure;
    ft_multiplotTFR(cfg, tfrbl);

Typically, visual grating tasks reliably elicit sustained gamma band response ~60-80 Hz in both humans (Hoogenboom N1, Schoffelen JM, Oostenveld R, Parkes LM, Fries P. (2006) Localizing human visual gamma-band activity in frequency, time and space. Neuroimage. 2006 Feb 1;29(3):764-73. Epub 2005 Oct 10.) and non human primates (Fries P, Scheeringa R, Oostenveld R. (2008) Finding Gamma. Neuron. 2008 May 8;58(3):303-5. doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2008.04.020.). The following lines will estimate oscillatory power in the higher frequencies > 40 Hz, baseline correct and plot the rusult.

    % estimate high frequency gamma
    cfg            = [];
    cfg.output     = 'pow';
    cfg.method     = 'mtmconvol';
    cfg.taper      = 'dpss';
    cfg.foi        = 40:2:120;
    cfg.t_ftimwin  = ones(length(cfg.foi),1).*0.5;
    cfg.tapsmofrq  = 6 ;
    cfg.toi        = -2:0.05:2;
    cfg.pad        = 'maxperlen';
    cfg.keeptrials = 'yes';
    tfrhf = ft_freqanalysis(cfg, data);

    % baseline correct
    cfg              = [];
    cfg.baseline     = [-.75 0];
    cfg.baselinetype = 'db';
    tfrhfbl = ft_freqbaseline(cfg, tfrhf);

    % plot
    figure;
    cfg         = [];
    cfg.xlim    = [0.18 0.87]
    cfg.ylim    = [53 80];
    cfg.layout  = lay;
    subplot(2,2,1); ft_topoplotTFR(cfg,tfrhfbl);
    cfg         = [];
    cfg.channel = {'chan123'};
    cfg.xlim    = [-.2 1.5];
    cfg.ylim    = [40 120];
    subplot(2,2,2); ft_singleplotTFR(cfg,tfrhfbl);

### Connectivity analysis

Now we can analysis the connectivity patterns that may arise due to coherence in the gamma band. Towards this end we'll use **[ft_connectivityanalysis](/reference/ft_connectivityanalysis)** and imaginary coherence as a metric of communication between electrodes. First, we take advantage of multitapering in order to estimated gamma power at 60 Hz and compute the connectivity between all possible electrode pairs.

    % estimate 60 Hz power
    cfg            = [];
    cfg.method     = 'mtmfft';
    cfg.output     = 'fourier';
    cfg.taper      = 'dpss';
    cfg.keeptrials = 'yes';
    cfg.tapsmofrq  = 2;
    cfg.foi        = 60;
    freq           = ft_freqanalysis(cfg, data);

    % then compute connectivity
    cfg         = [];
    cfg.method  = 'coh';
    cfg.complex = 'absimag'; % check absimag solves the abs on line 161
    conn = ft_connectivityanalysis(cfg,freq);

Now we plot the coherence of a reference electrode with maximal gamma power relative to the remaining electrodes. In this case the electrode is 'chan123' with an index number 119.

    %% plot coherence from max gamma chan to all other
    coh.label =data.label;
    coh.dimord = 'chan_time'
    coh.avg = conn.cohspctrm(119,:)';
    coh.time = 1;

    cfg           = [];
    cfg.layout    = lay;
    cfg.colormap  = 'jet';
    cfg.zlim      = [-.2 .2];
    cfg.colorbar  = 'yes';
    cfg.interactive = 'no';
    cfg.marker    = 'off';
    cfg.highlight = 'on';
    cfg.highlightchannel = {'chan123'};
    cfg.highlightsymbol = '*';
    cfg.highlightcolor  = [1 0 1];
    cfg.highlightsize   = 12;
    cfg.highlightfontsize =12;
    figure;
    ft_topoplotER(cfg,coh);

_Figure 8: Coherence between a reference occipital electrode (magenta) and all of the remaining electrodes._

Finally, we use **[ft_networkanalysis](/reference/ft_networkanalysis)** to illustrate a rather formal description of the connectivity pattern in the form of a graph.

    % calculate graph theoretical metric
    fn=fieldnames(conn);
    parameter = 'degrees';
    cfg           = [];
    cfg.method    = parameter;
    cfg.parameter = fn{3};
    cfg.threshold = .1;
    deg = ft_networkanalysis(cfg, conn);

    % plot the result
    cfg             = [];
    cfg.layout      = lay;
    cfg.colormap    = 'jet';
    cfg.parameter   = parameter;
    cfg.zlim        = [-15 15];
    cfg.colorbar    = 'yes';
    cfg.interactive = 'no';
    cfg.marker      = 'off';
    figure;
    ft_topoplotTFR(cfg, deg);

## Summary and conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated various analysis steps associated with an evaluation of electrocorticographic recordings.

First, the data has been organized in a FieldTrip appropriate format. Psychophysiological data is often represented over various recording sites. Accordingly, data exploration is often aided by a "map" with positions corresponding to the locations of each recording site. In the context of invasive recordings it is often the case that at least a photograph capturing the implanted grid array is available. This information can be used to construct an electrode layout essential for data exploration.

Subsequently, the data has been further evaluated by decomposing the linear superposition of activity using independent components by means of ICA. On the basis of the topographic layout and the component time courses the spatial and temporal characteristics of the data had been evaluated.

Next, the spectral characteristic in the data were evaluated. It is well documented that in experimental context such as the present, i.e. visual stimulation with gratings characterized by high spatial frequency, a prominent stimulus induced power modulation in the gamma frequency range ~60 Hz is observed. The evaluated data set confirmed this observation demonstrating a prominent increase in high frequency activity. This increase was most prominent over visual areas. Following the steps described above it was possible to conclude that stimulus presentation is associated with specific brain activity characterized by time (0-2 sec post stim), frequency (~60Hz) and space (visual) "bounderies".

Given this knowledge often we seek to characterize some quantity of interaction or connectivity between brain structures in this case electrodes. This tutorial applied "coherence" as method of choice although there are various, equally valid other methods implemented in FieldTrip. Descriptively, using a reference electrode (seed) defined as the maximal gamma band power it could be demonstrated that the propagation of the observed stimulus induced brain response is rather spatially constrained to several nearby electrodes surrounding the seed region.

Finally, a graph theoretical approach has been applied to formally describe one fundamental property of a node (electrode) in a graph (set of electrodes)- the node degree. This metric essentially describes an aspect of a network topology- the amount of connections of a given node to all possible nodes in the graph. The interpretation of the results however are often not straight forward and require an appropriate statistical contrast, which is not covered in this tutorial.

Several analysis strategies were applied but not explained in further detail. If you are unclear on the organization of the data structure suitable for analysis in FieldTrip please have a look at [this FAQ](/faq/how_can_i_import_my_own_dataformat). When performing frequency analysis, parameter such as length of the time window, desired and given frequency resolution etc. are very important. What is the basis for these decisions is not covered by this tutorial. If you are interested in detailed explanations of the motivation behind such decisions please evaluate the [time-frequency tutorial](/tutorial/timefrequencyanalysis). If you are interested in creating your own electrode layout you can consult the [layout tutorial](/tutorial/layout). If you are interested in a different connectivity analysis that goes somewhat beyond correlation, you can continue with the [connectivity analysis](/tutorial/connectivity) tutorial.
