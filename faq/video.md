# Are the FieldTrip lectures available on video?

Yes and no. Some material is online available, but not all. Please see the [video documentation](/video) page.

We are planning to record more future lectures on camera. However, that does not automatically mean that all recorded material will automatically be posted online. Ideally we would indeed post it on our youTube channel, but making (i.e. shooting and editing) good quality videos is not easy and making bad quality videos available would not be beneficial for the project in the long run. Also, not all presenters feel comfortable with having their presentation in the public.

So it is part of our ongoing efforts to improve the dissemination of FieldTrip and the methods implemented in it, and we do hope that we will get the hang of making it available as [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course).

In case you want to know more about how we perform the recordings, please have a look [here](/development/guideline/video).
