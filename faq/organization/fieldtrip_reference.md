# How should I refer to FieldTrip in my publication?

We would appreciate it to be mentioned in your publication if you have used FieldTrip for a considerable part of your analysis.

Please cite the **[FieldTrip reference paper](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2011/156869/)** when you have used FieldTrip for data analysis in your study.

Oostenveld, R., Fries, P., Maris, E., Schoffelen, JM (2011). **FieldTrip: Open Source Software for Advanced Analysis of MEG, EEG, and Invasive Electrophysiological Data.** Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, Volume 2011 (2011), Article ID 156869, doi:10.1155/2011/156869

Besides referring to the paper, you could use a phrasing like this, where _REF_ corresponds to the reference to the paper.
