# Which datasets are used in the documentation and where are they used?

The FieldTrip website and download server include a variety of datasets. some of these are used in the [tutorials](/tutorial), while others are used in [example MATLAB scripts](/example). All of these datasets were recorded from humans, unless otherwise specified.

In this [frequently asked question](/faq/open_data) you can find links to other open access datasets.

## MEG-language

- Dutch sentences presented auditory. Investigated the effects of semantic (in)congruency on sentence processing.
- 151-channel CTF MEG system
- The head shape and the anatomical MRI is included for Subject01 and used for the headmodel tutorials.
- There are some additional single-subject raw datasets from this study, which were in the past used to show the effect of the planar gradient transform but which are not used at the moment. These are available from our download server as Subject02.zip, Subject03.zip and Subject04.zip. These additional subjects are also used to explain batch processing and distributed computing.
- Group results of this study (comprising 10 subjects) are used in the statistics tutorials.

## MEG-visuomotor151-k

Modulation of the hazard rate of the stimulus' speed change: UP-schedule (likelihood of stimulus change _increases_ as the duration of the constant stimulus increases) and DOWN-schedule (likelihood of stimulus to change _decreases_ a duration of the constant stimulus increases). Analysed change in coherence between oscillations in motor cortex and spinal cord neurons as an indicator of corticospinal interaction.
