# What is the difference between the ACPC, MNI, SPM and TAL coordinate systems?

There are a number of coordinate systems that have the origin, i.e., the [0,0,0] point, at the Anterior Commissure and that have a RAS orientation (i.e. the x-axis pointing to the right, the y-axis pointing to anterior, the z-axis pointing to superior).

- ACPC is used if the geometry is according to the individual subject head/brain size.
- TAL is used if the geometry is piecewise scaled to match the Talairach-Tournoux (1988) atlas.
- MNI, MNI152 or SPM is used if the geometry is spatially warped to the MNI152 template brain.
- MNI305 or FSAVERAGE is used if the geometry is spatially warped to the MNI305 template brain.

In all cases the origin is at the [Anterior Commissure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_commissure) and the negative y-axis is passing through the [Posterior Commissure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_commissure).

Coordinates expressed in the TAL, MNI/MNI152/SPM, and MNI305/FSAVERAGE coordinate system all imply that some spatial deformation was done; they can be looked up in the corresponding template or atlas. For ACPC coordinates no deformation was done; they can be used to express location in an individual subject, or measure distance, volume or surface area.
