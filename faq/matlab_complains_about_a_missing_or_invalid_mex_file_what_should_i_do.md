# MATLAB complains about a missing or invalid mex file, what should I do?

The FieldTrip version that we release includes compiled mex files for the most common platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS). However, it might be that you have a combination of operating system and MATLAB on which the precompiled mex files are not included or on which they do not work. In that case you have to recompile them yourself.

The source code for the FieldTrip mex files is mostly contained in the `fieldtrip/src` directory. Some mex files are contained in `fieldtrip/external`, for example for SPM. Those are not the responsibility of the FieldTrip team.

{% include markup/red %}
Note that in general the toolboxes in `fieldtrip/external` are **not** maintained by the FieldTrip team, but come from an external source.

If you run into problems with mex files from SPM, i.e. the ones included in `fieldtrip/external/spmX`, you should have a look at <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/MATLAB>. See also further down on this page.
{% include markup/end %}

## Recommended way of recompiling

To recompile all mex files at once, you can use the **[ft_compile_mex](/reference/utilities/ft_compile_mex)** function.

## Alternative way of recompiling

You can recompile individual mex files for your platform using the following commands:

    cd fieldtrip/src
    mex meg_leadfield1.c
    mex plgndr.c
    mex read_24bit.c

The following files all depend on some shared code in geometry.c and geometry.h, hence the compilation process is slighty different for these:

    mex -I. -c geometry.c
    mex -I. -c solid_angle.c ; mex -o solid_angle solid_angle.o geometry.o
    mex -I. -c lmoutr.c      ; mex -o lmoutr      lmoutr.o      geometry.o
    mex -I. -c ptriproj.c    ; mex -o ptriproj    ptriproj.o    geometry.o
    mex -I. -c ltrisect.c    ; mex -o ltrisect    ltrisect.o    geometry.o
    mex -I. -c routlm.c      ; mex -o routlm      routlm.o      geometry.o
    mex -I. -c plinproj.c    ; mex -o plinproj    plinproj.o    geometry.o

If you are on a Windows computer, the compiled object files with have extension .obj instead of .o and hence you then should do

    mex -I. -c geometry.c
    mex -I. -c solid_angle.c ; mex solid_angle.c solid_angle.obj geometry.obj
    mex -I. -c lmoutr.c      ; mex lmoutr.c      lmoutr.obj      geometry.obj
    mex -I. -c ptriproj.c    ; mex ptriproj.c    ptriproj.obj    geometry.obj
    mex -I. -c ltrisect.c    ; mex ltrisect.c    ltrisect.obj    geometry.obj
    mex -I. -c routlm.c      ; mex routlm.c      routlm.obj      geometry.obj
    mex -I. -c plinproj.c    ; mex plinproj.c    plinproj.obj    geometry.obj

After compilation the mex files are automatically at the right location.

Note that most of the mex files include a m-file wrapper which will try to do an auto compilation. Again, the autocompilation has not (and can not) be tested on all possible platforms, so your mileage may vary.

If you are using the Visual Studio Compiler and get an error similar to:

    error LNK2005: mexFunction already defined in ptriproj.obj

then try this line replacing ptriproj with the file you are trying to compile.

    mex -I. -c ptriproj.c ; mex ptriproj.c geometry.obj

Note in Linux: If you are get the error message "cannot find -lstdc++", you can install the libstdc++5 package using your package manager.
If, after the install of libtdc++5, the lstdc++ error persists, just do a symbolic link like this

    ln -s /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so

and it should work.

# Known issues with SPM mex files and workarounds

Some mex files have been compiled but have not been tested by the FieldTrip developpers on all current platforms that we support. Examples are the mex files provided by external software packages. Below is a list of known issues and alternative workarounds, other than recompiling the incompatible mex files yourself.

### SPM8 mexmaci64 mex files fail on MATLAB 2017 and up

Producing the following error

    Invalid mex-file '/Users/roboos/matlab/fieldtrip/external/spm8/spm_conv_vol.mexmaci64
    dlopen(/Users/roboos/matlab/fieldtrip/external/spm8/spm_conv_vol.mexmaci64, 6): Library not loaded: @loader_path/libmex.dylib
    Referenced from: /Users/roboos/matlab/fieldtrip/external/spm8/spm_conv_vol.mexmaci64
    Reason: image not found.

1. You can recompile the SPM8 mex files. A makefile and instructions are provided on <https://www.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM#Installation>.

2. You can use the maintenance version of SPM8, which has newer mex files, see <https://github.com/spm/spm8/tree/maint>.

3. Most mex file issues are resolved using the latest version of SPM12. You can specify the use of SPM12 with `cfg.spmversion = 'spm12'`

4. For a more permanent solution that applies to all functions from the FieldTrip toolbox, you can set SPM12 as the default version in your `startup.m`

    global ft_default
    ft_default.spmversion = 'spm12'
    ft_defaults % this loads the rest of the defaults, the existing ft_default fields will not be touched

### GIFTI mexmaci64 mex file on MATLAB 2017 and up

When you get the following error

    Error using read_gifti_file (line 17)
    [GIFTI] Loading of XML file /Users/arjsto/Projects/Ecog/data/IR30/recon/freesurfer/SUMA/std.141.lh.pial.gii failed.

you can replace the `xml_findstr.mexmaci64` in `external/gifti/@xmltree/private` by the version from <https://github.com/spm/spm12/blob/master/%40xmltree/private/xml_findstr.mexmaci64>.
