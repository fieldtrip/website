# Which methodological details should I report in an EEG/MEG manuscript?

This is a checklist for authors to use it prior to submission of a manuscript, to ensure that the manuscript provides key information. It originates from the following paper, which also provides more background on how to report methodological details on MEG and EEG studies.

-   The number of trials used for averaging (if any) is described, reporting the number of trials in each condition and each group of subjects. This should include both the mean number of trials in each cell and the range of trials included

### Measurement procedures

-   Measurement procedures are described, including the measurement technique (e.g., mean amplitude), the time window and baseline period, sensor sites, etc.
-   For peak amplitude measures, the following is included: whether the peak was an absolute or local peak, whether visual inspection or automatic detection was used, and the number of trials contributing to the averages used for measurement
-   An a priori rationale is given for the selection of time windows, electrode sites, etc.
-   Both descriptive and inferential statistics are included

### Statistical analyses
