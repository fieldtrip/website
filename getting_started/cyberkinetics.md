# Getting started with Cyberkinetics data

Support for the Cyberkinetics format was initially implemented using the Neuroshare toolbox, see <http://www.neuroshare.org>. This was never implemented as cross-platform implementation and limited to 32-bit Windows platforms. It has not been maintained since about 10 years. Hence we expect that the neuroshare importer will not work for you any more.

Cyberkinetics (the company) now continues as [Blackrock Microsystems](http://blackrockmicro.com), which maintains the [Neural Processing Matlab Kit](https://github.com/BlackrockNeurotech/NPMK) (NPMK) for reading data from the (former) Cyberkinetics and (current) Blackrock file formats.

Please see the [Getting started with Blackrock data](/getting_started/blackrock) for more details.
