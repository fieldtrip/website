# Getting started

FieldTrip is a MATLAB toolbox that contains a set of separate (high-level) functions, it does **not** have a graphical user interface. The toolbox functions can be combined into an analysis pipeline, i.e. a MATLAB script containing all steps of your analysis. For this reason, if you are new to MATLAB scripting or EEG/MEG/iEEG/NIRS analysis, FieldTrip might not be the most efficient for you. If you are persistent and eager to learn, the list of [review papers and teaching material](/references_to_review_papers_and_teaching_material) can help you on your way.

For a general overview of how FieldTrip is designed, please have a look at the [reference paper](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2011/156869). By far the best way to get hands-on experience with FieldTrip is by following the [tutorials](/tutorial), the [walkthrough](/walkthrough) and through the other [documentation](/documentation). If you have questions that are not answered by the documentation or in the [FAQ](/faq), you can register on the [email list](/discussion_list) and ask the other users and the developers for help. Also, FieldTripping is not something you do alone; inform yourself about colleagues that use (or want to use) FieldTrip.

We organize [FieldTrip workshops](/workshop) and a yearly “Advanced EEG/MEG analysis” [toolkit course](https://www.ru.nl/donders/agenda/donders-tool-kits) at the Donders Institute in which we lecture and give hands-on training sessions. Attending one of these will probably benefit your understanding and analysis skills. You can also watch [online video lectures](/video) that were recorded at previous workshops.

If you are eager to get started with your specific data, please proceed to the user documentation section on [importing your own data](/reading_data).
