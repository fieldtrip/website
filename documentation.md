# Documentation

The [tutorials](/tutorial) will help you to get started by providing examples that you can copy-and-paste into MATLAB. The [introduction tutorial](/tutorial/introduction) provides a short introduction in the the ideas behind the FieldTrip toolbox. The [Walkthrough](/walkthrough) will give you a more thorough overview of the conceptual ideas behind MEG and EEG analysis and how the toolbox is used.

The [frequently asked questions](/faq) section provides a lot of practical information. Furthermore, the [example MATLAB scripts](/example) contain pieces of documentation that are often not so elaborate as the tutorials, but that go in more detail into specific aspects of the data, code or analysis.

In the [reference documentation](/reference) you find an overview of all main functions in FieldTrip and the [configuration index](/configuration) has a list of their configuration options.

Sometimes we prepare dedicated course material for [workshops](/workshop), which is also shared on this website, together with [video](/video) recordings of lectures.

If you are very eager to get started with your specific data, please proceed to the user documentation section on importing [your own data](/reading_data).
