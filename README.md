- Pages that contain tags must have a title.
- Tags should be in lower case.
- All tags should appear on a single line.
- Variables passed in an include must be specified in quotes.
- Code blocks should have an empty line before and after them.
- Shared pages should go in \_include/shared.
- Markdown documentation can be found on <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>.

## Limitations when viewing on GitHub

Most of the Markdown formatting will show up nicely here on GitHub, but there are some limitations.

- Hyperlinks will not be pointing to the correct pages.
- Images are not included correctly.
- YouTube videos will not be included correctly.
- Highlighted sections will not show correctly.
- Code blocks don't have syntax highlighting.

## Evaluating the website locally

If you make changes that you want to evaluate prior to publishing them, you have to install Ruby, Bundler and Jekyll. Subsequently you can do

    bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --livereload

which will convert the Markdown into HTML and serve your local copy of the website on <http://localhost:4000>.

## Checking for broken links and missing images

    wget --spider -r -nd -nv -o spider.log http://localhost:4000
    grep -B1 'broken link!' spider.log  | grep http > broken.log
