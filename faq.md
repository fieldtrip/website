# Frequently Asked Questions

On this page you can find answers to a variety of FieldTrip and MATLAB related questions.

We invite you to [add your own](/contribute) example scripts or frequently asked questions on the website. Also tutorials can be added. Every time you explain somebody something about FieldTrip, please consider whether you could use the website for this, so others can learn from it as well.

See also the [tutorials](/tutorial) and [example scripts](/example).
